22313,118,teacher: hello <student>!  student: hi <teacher>!,1,1
22314,118,"teacher: hi - welcome to the chat how are you? and where are you in the world?  student: thank you! and thank you for letting me improve my english with this study! i am fine, thank you. just a bit cold, it is getting cold here in austria. i am italian, but i moved to graz last year.",3,3
22315,118,"teacher: oh austria, interesting! all the pastry and music :)  student: yes, it is a nice place to be :) and you? are you from the uk?",3,3
22316,118,"teacher: i'm from ukraine, but i've lived in the uk for the last few years do you speak german as well?  student: oh, i see...so you also know what it means to leave your country. even though i suspect you knew the language before reaching the uk. i speak some german, but i am still working on it (the covid lockdown didn't help). i also speak spanish to a decent level.",3,4
22317,118,"teacher: yes, i was an english teacher and cambridge examiner back in ukraine. and yes, i know about the whole leaving far from home / making a new country your second home amazing, you're a polyglot! i learned some german at university, but i'm a good few years out of practice and oh so rusty :)  student: sort of polyglot...but i enjoy learning languages. well, you also speak many languages! i believe it is easy to get rusty with german: it is easy to forget about grammar and nouns' genders.",4,3
22318,118,"teacher: i don't really count german among them any more. oh my, genders and cases basically broke me! even though there are only three cases in german whereas my native russian has six and ukrainian 7. it didn't help!  student: as an italian i also have troubles with long words...i really believe english to be a lot easier...",3,2
22319,118,"teacher: do nouns have genders in italian? oh yes, german's notorious for its long words, isn't it? yes, i agree, there is a reason english took over the world  student: yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with german, there are some simple rules to identify a noun's gender. that is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel.",3,3
22320,118,"teacher: yes, very similar to russian / ukrainian. basically, does it end in 'a' :)  student: it is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, i don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin's seeds'",3,2
22321,118,"teacher: haha, i see your point!! but i like that german is a bit like lego. once you've learned the most common roots, you can guess the meaning of many words  student: indeed that is true...and i also find it more 'precise' than italian. don't get me wrong: you can be precise with italian, but in german it is as if the language is ingrained with some rules that force you to be precise.",3,4
22322,118,"teacher: hmm, that's an interesting observation. would you say english and german have that in common?  student: while i find english more 'practical' when talking about technical things...both because most technical terms are in english and because it has a somewhat simplified grammar with respect to italian. i would say english is a bit more on the practical side, german on the precision side. but i'd say english is closed to german in this.",3,3
22323,118,"teacher: interesting, i've got to think about this one! yes, i suppose as a germanic language it will be a tiny thing: we don't really use possessive 's with inanimate nouns for example, <student>'s book vs. the genders of nounds *nouns, sorry  student: indeed i felt weird when typing 'pumpkin's'..",3,2
22324,118,"teacher: yes, that's it, you probably know it intuitively! the names of animals count as animate nounds too, e.g. a swan's bill, a squirrel's tail but 'the legs of a table'  student: unfortunately i like to use language: i have read a lot in english. thank you!",4,3
22325,118,"teacher: this is not unfortunate, is it? :)  student: but 'bread with seeds of pumpkin' doesn't sound right...",3,2
22326,118,"teacher: oh, and 's is used with time phrases too, as you probably know. this week's newspaper, a month's salary  student: no, it isn't...but i realise just now how much i know 'intuitively' but i don't really control.",4,3
22327,118,"teacher: no, that's because it's 'pumpkin seeds' :)  student: okay...so a day's work, yes, i know this intuitively",3,2
22328,118,"teacher: that's a sign of someone who is bilingual or a native speaker it's only if you learn the language from textbooks that you know the rules  student: okay, then i will be extra careful about it ;) even though my guess would be that many english speakers get it wrong too... i agree with you on learning from the textbooks...the problem is that oftentimes, especially here in italy, you study the grammar before you really know how to write a proper sentence.",3,3
22329,118,"teacher: back to the bread, you can just go with 'pumpkin seed bread' german-style, but in three words yes, that's how i learnt english, grammar first! i feel that it pays off though if you have a chance to practise a lot afterwards  student: easier to pronounce ;) okay...so in general i would put before the noun 'bread' the adjectives, in this case pumpkin seed. or whole flower bread...okay, i got this!",3,2
22330,118,"teacher: yes, that would make a compound noun yes, wholewheat flour bread  student: well, after high school i studied math and now i work with artificial intelligence: so i always used english for 'practical' reasons, but it has been a while since i opened a grammar book.",1,4
22331,118,"teacher: or sourdough bread, the lockdown craze in the uk :)  student: haha, yes! i wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then i stopped fearing that this is the us american spelling... would that be wrong?",3,3
22332,118,"teacher: hmm, let me think. whole milk vs. (semi-)skimmed milk but wholewheat flour we want to stress here that the flour is made out of whole wheat rather than the idea that the flour is whole  student: i am unsure about what 'flour is whole' would mean...",3,2
22333,118,"teacher: oh, what i mean is that we use 'wholewheat flour' as opposed to 'whole flour' because, as you say, 'whole flour' does not make sense  student: okay, thank you for the clarification!",3,1
22334,118,"teacher: no worries. you mentioned that you are interested in punctuation in the sign-up form in the following sentence, a punctuation mark could make it much clearer what you mean i wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then i stopped fearing that this is the us american spelling...  student: yes, punctuation is one of those things that i have never fully understood. the oxford comma and so on... is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted?",2,3
22335,118,"teacher: not really, but when i first read it, i thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the american spelling as in 'you were not afraid anymore' if you put a comma after 'stopped', that would make it much clearer in my opinion  student: haha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing.",4,2
22336,118,"teacher: i wanted to write... but then i stopped, fearing that this is the american spelling does it make sense?  student: indeed! after you wrote about what you understood while reading the sentence i was wondering wether i would put the comma after 'then' or after 'stopped'... would both options be correct?",3,3
22337,118,"teacher: if you put a comma after then, this would definitely read like you are not afraid that this is american spelling anymore))  student: yes, indeed...i think this option came to my mind because in italian there is an expression i would have used in this context i.e., 'poi per', which is often followed by the comma.",3,3
22338,118,"teacher: i see! i'm thinking of an example i was afraid to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then, i stopped fearing, put my face mask on and went silly example, just ot illustrate the point *to illustrate mind you, your original sentence was good without the comma too, and this is a confusing thing about the english punctuation: very little of it is obligatory or regulated by clear rules  student: i see your point, but a comma would have made the sentence much less ambiguous...",3,4
22339,118,"teacher: yes, true! i'd like to recommend an excellent book on the subject. it's called 'eats, shoots and leaves' by lynne truss  student: thank you for the recommendation! i will definitely take a look at it!",3,2
22340,118,"teacher: it's a really engaging read and explains some of those punctuation nuances really well the title was inspired by a joke about a panda. do you know this one?  student: no, i don't... ...and i don't see how pandas could come into play with that title, to be honest ;)",4,3
22341,118,"teacher: well, a panda walks into a cafe, eats a sandwich, then produces a gun, fires two shots in the air and heads towards the exit the waiter asks, 'what was this about?' the panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and shows it to the waiter the entry for 'panda' says, 'panda. large black-and-white mammal, native to china. eats, shoots and leaves.'  student: haha...this time there was an extra comma! very nice :)",4,4
22342,118,"teacher: yes, exactly! the importance of punctuation)) so, what kind of ai are you working on?  student: currently i am working on a few projects...but the main one, which made me realise that my english knowledge is okay but not excellent, is about gec...that is, you guessed it, grammatical error correction.",3,3
22343,118,"teacher: interesting! are there any areas of grammar that you think you would like to improve? your english is excellent, and i'm nit-picking to find something to help you with, to be honest  student: well, thank you! i am not sure...as an italian i realise that my language use is a bit peculiar, for example i tend to use a lot of words with latin etymology. if you noticed this, maybe i would like to know some more common alternatives... or there are some sentences which i am not sure if or why they are correct. i guess those could shed some light on some grammatical areas i don't fully control.",4,4
22344,118,"teacher: oh i see what you are saying (i haven't noticed). it would be wrong not to take advantage of 60% of the english wordstock. if i recall correctly, this is how much the words of latin origin make up  student: i see, then i will ask you the following: is the sentence 'there are two teachers in class' wrong? i have found something similar in a grammar book, and they suggested 'there are two teachers in the class' as the correct version. do they have different meanings, or is me not seeing what is wrong with the first one?",3,3
22345,118,"teacher: ah, articles! yes, you usually need to use 'the' with indications of place  student: what i was wondering is if, in this case, 'class' could also mean 'lesson' and so the first one could be correct...",3,4
22346,118,"teacher: class' in this sentence is a singular noun, so you need some kind of an article.  student: as in two teachers are teaching the lesson...but maybe it would be a singular noun anyway...",3,3
22347,118,"teacher: i see what you're saying, but class=lesson is also a singular noun and requires an article yes, that's right! and, just like you said right now, you would be more likely to say 'two teachers are teaching a class'  student: okay, anyway thank you for clearing that up! i didn't realise there are this many rules connect with 'animated objects' or 'indications of place'.",3,4
22348,118,"teacher: i've got an idea. maybe you could send me a piece of your writing that you think could be improved prior to the next class? then we could have a more focussed practice next time, looking at the grammar, style and punctuation  student: yes, that is definitely an option. okay! i will sent you two pieces of writing. one written in a speedy manner, one more carefully...",4,3
22349,118,"teacher: ok, excellent! would a class at the same time next week suit you?  student: i would prefer it to start at 11:00, but if that is not possible 9:30 will be fine :) (oh, i forgot the 'a.m.' there...)",3,1
22350,118,"teacher: that's ok, please give me a minute to calculate the time difference is it 11 gmt?  student: yes which means 14 here (so i can take the lesson after lunch)",3,2
22351,118,"teacher: just checking my timetable we should be still on summer time here in the uk, so yes, 11 gmt is good!  student: okay. well, let me know if you realise the time changes. perfect! thank you for your time! i am looking forward to the next lesson :)",3,3
22352,118,"teacher: no, it should be fine. it just takes me a moment to switch between time zones, with students in different countries my pleasure, have a lovely week, speak to you on tuesday!  student: you too, bye!",4,2
22354,64,student: good afternoon <teacher>  teacher: hi <student> - how are you?,3,2
22355,64,"student: today is the second day of my new cycle quarantine. i suppose i'm used to living in isolation, because my schedule is like the previous 14 days.  teacher: yes i guess you must be used to it by now! is there anything different about where you are now compared to before?",3,3
22356,64,"student: no!! maybe it is just living in different hotels. but sometimes i really want to go for a run.  teacher: right i see...yes i'd really like to go for a run too. i normally run a lot but i have a knee injury at the moment. ironically, i'd be stuck inside anyway even without this virus! so you just have to stay in a room all day? how do you get your meals?",3,4
22357,64,"student: yes, i know you said it before. without doubt, it will be my most memorable 28 days,  teacher: yes,,you'll look back on it with nostalgia ....",4,2
22358,64,student: everyday nurses give to me normal males.  teacher: the nurses give you normal meals yeah? do they wear full protective equipment?,2,3
22359,64,student: but they all different. yes!!! they all wearing full protective equipment. and i was required to test my body temperature twice a day.  teacher: it must be like something out of a movie!? sorry <student> but: 'they all wearing full protective equipment.' happy with this??,3,2
22360,64,"student: when i lived in hospital at the first day, everything i thought is like a movie of 100%.  teacher: yes i can imagine!",2,3
22361,64,"student: yes....i was happy with that, because i can far away from my parents...haha  teacher: oh right i see! but what i meant was: are you happy with the grammar in english of your sentence??!! 'they all wearing full protective equipment.'",2,2
22362,64,student: maybe i need to use present perfect  teacher: ah ...well if you're talking about right now then the present continuous is ok but have you used it correctly here? this is the same mistake you made before (that's why i'm asking you again!),3,3
22363,64,student: no..i think i talk about a period of the time.  teacher: ok <student> ...hold on don't worry about changing the tense...it's not the problem here you can use the presnent continuous but you have to make it correctly! with two words remember!!,3,2
22364,64,student: yes!!  teacher: they _____ wearing ...'?,1,1
22365,64,student: they are wearing  teacher: yes ok good thanks!,1,1
22366,64,student: i think i need to punish myself.  teacher: you could also use present simple here: 'they all wear protective ...' = correct too,2,2
22367,64,"student: i always forget it  teacher: yes don't worry ...it's normal ..not only you! 2 steps forward one step back ..it's normal! <student> let me give you your paragraph from yesterday.... one of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. as a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.",3,3
22368,64,"student: yes.. i learn a new word of 'copy' is 'imitate'  teacher: yes that's a very good idea! you could definitely use it here this is quite good in many ways...but i wonder: there are 4 sentences here. can you put them in a different order so the paragraph is a bit more logical? you only have to change one sentence (i mean put it in a different place) which one ? 1,2,3, or 4? don't worry if you're not sure...",3,4
22369,64,student: apply 2 to 1  teacher: so hold on..you mean the first sentence should be different? i like that first sentence!!,2,1
22370,64,"student: ok..i am not sure  teacher: no problem...well for me <student> changing round 2 and 3 seems a bit better so...one of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. as a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example. so the 'as a result' directly follows the fact that they can't tell it isn't real do you see?",4,3
22371,64,student: yes.. i see it  teacher: ok cool ...,2,1
22372,64,"student: it become more logic, 1. topic sentence 2.the explain of main idea 3.consequence  teacher: yes i think so but don't worry too much ..i think your priority <student> is still gettgin the language right ...your understanding of paragraph/essay structure is pretty good i think",2,3
22373,64,"student: so..this structure is normal and academic in english writing, right?  teacher: yes absolutely - it's fine",3,1
22374,64,student: i like it  teacher: ok <student> - can i give you a choice..do you want to try answering some part 3 speaking questions or would you prefer trying another paragraph (on a different topic),3,2
22375,64,"student: i prefer to trying another paragraph  teacher: ok fine...hold on a sec (by the way, you can suggest a topic if you want to practise a particular one..if not i'll choose for you!)",3,3
22376,64,student: i don't have any ideas.....  teacher: ok no probs hold on,2,1
22377,64,student: ok  teacher: in some countries people prefer renting their homes to buying them. what are the advantages and disadvantages of renting? ok make sense? give me a couple of main ideas just with basic keywords if you like...i'll give you a minute ok?,3,3
22378,64,"student: 1. cheaper 2.easy to moving 3.high price can rent a high quality house, but it still cheaper than buy a normal house and disadvantage is following...  teacher: ok yes understood thanks...ok i'll wait!",1,2
22379,64,student: 1. can't buy huge and expensive furnitures 2. sometimes it doesn't feel like home.  teacher: ok thanks <student>! can i just check your first disadvantage? the 'furniture' one? what do you mean here?,3,3
22380,64,"student: like... tables, beds, refrigerator ......  teacher: ok yes i understand what furniture means! (not a fridge by the way) ...but why can't you buy a large table for example if you;re renting?",4,2
22381,64,"student: because when you move to another city or place, it is very unconvenience to move them.  teacher: ah ok i'm with you! yes of course (just checking though because you'll have to explain this if you use it as a main idea right?) quick question: 'it is very unconvenience ' what kind of word do you need after 'very'? (noun/verb/adjective?",3,3
22382,64,student: adjective i think..  teacher: ok good yes! can you change your word to an adjective? incon_ _ _ _ _ _ _ ',2,3
22383,64,student: very inconvenience  teacher: hold on <student>....'importance' = adjective or noun?,2,2
22384,64,student: noun because important is an adjective.  teacher: ok good! can you apply this rule to your two words from just before? so 'inconvenience' = noun/adjective?,3,3
22385,64,student: is a noun  teacher: ok good..and the adjective you need is?,2,3
22386,64,student: inconvenient  teacher: ok good! so <student> ...getting verb tenses and getting nouns/verb/adjective forms right are two big things you can improve for a better score ok?,3,2
22387,64,"student: ok,thanks  teacher: quick test coming up ok? choose the right option for each sentence : we need silence/silent in the room please. its difficult to tell the difference/different between twins. lung cancer is a common consequence/consequent of smoking.",4,3
22388,64,student: silent/difference/consequence  teacher: thanks <student>...you need to change one of your answers! which one?,3,2
22389,64,student: slience  teacher: yes ok good! you need 'something' right (a noun in other words) .... you can say need to + verb,2,1
22390,64,student: need to slent silent  teacher: ah well.....need to + verb so....where's the verb in your last example?? you would need to add one! 'we need to ____ silent now.'??,3,2
22391,64,student: we need to be silent now.  teacher: ok good! good to focus on this stuff! ok <student> speak to you after the break..bye for now...,3,1
22393,43,"teacher: welcome back <student>...  student: hey, i am here",3,1
22394,43,teacher: ok a quick vocabulary exercise for you based on earlier ... hold on  student: ok,3,1
22395,43,teacher: just match up the letters and numbers and show me ok? take a couple of minutes and if you aren't sure no problem: 1. change 2. personality (in general) 3. be born 4. predetermined 5. get from (e.g. parents) 6. give to (e.g. children) 7. characteristic (e.g. one particular example) 8. things that are the same 9. to be born with a. pass on b. fixed c. alter d. similarities e. innate f. birth g. character h. inherit i. quality is that clear?  student: yes,3,2
22396,43,teacher: ok  student: 1- c / 2 - g / 3 - f / 4 - b / 5 - h / 6 - a / 7 - e / 8 - d / 9 - f i am not sure of number 7,3,3
22397,43,"teacher: ok thanks <student> - very good overall hold on... ok so 'innate' = something your born with e.g. children seem to have an innate sense of fairness. and e.g. patience, honesty, a sense of humour are all examples of particular personal qualities or characteristics (ok?!) so 7 e !  student: okey~i write them on notebook",3,2
22398,43,"teacher: ok great - ok can i give you one final test now - you will need one word from the second group to complete the following sentences 1. my father ___________ his love of fishing to me and my brother.. 2. our personalities are __________, perhaps not from ________, but certainly when we reach adulthood. 3. beethovens musical talent was ________. he could compose symphonies from the age of four! 4. honesty and kindness are very important __________. 5. its very difficult or perhaps impossible to __________ your character your genes play a very significant role. ok? one word from the second group...  student: okey, i know the second group is from a to i",3,2
22399,43,teacher: yes that's it  student: 1. pass on 2. similarities / inherit 3. brith 4.character 5. alter,2,1
22400,43,teacher: ok thanks <student> - good answers for 1 and 5. let me make the other examples clearer  student: okey,3,2
22401,43,teacher: so number you need an adjective which means 'something that is set/that you can't change...and the next word in number two means 'from the first day of you life'! number 3: his talent was something he was born with e.g. 'an i_ _ _ _ _ 'talent'. and number 4: kindness etc ...these are particular characteristics or 'qu.........'?! sorry the first comment connects to number 2 ok?  student: innate quality,2,3
22402,43,teacher: ok <student> ..so number 2: if i say our personalities can't be changed i can say: 'our personalities are 'f _ _ _ _ '?  student: our personalities are fixed,3,2
22403,43,teacher: yes good ...and maybe not from ' b _ _ _ _ ' but quite soon afterwards?  student: brith,3,1
22404,43,teacher: ok yes 'birth' and number 3: beethoven;s talent was 'i _ _ _ _ ' ? it means something he was born with!  student: innate,3,3
22405,43,teacher: ok great! and e.g. patience/honesty/kindness/selfishness etc are ....?  student: character,3,2
22406,43,teacher: you need a countable noun here ...so e.g. 'character' is not possible (at least in this context) - a person's character is made up of different _______? qu....' or 'ch...' = both possible  student: qualities characters,3,1
22407,43,teacher: yes good ...or characteristics ...ok? both are countable and mean particular features ...your character or personality = uncountable (at least for one person they are uncountable ) so in other words a person's character or personality includes different specific qualities or characteristics (ok?)  student: not ok,3,2
22408,43,teacher: ha! hold on...  student: we can only write characteristics here,3,2
22409,43,"teacher: no 'qualities' is ok too = the same thing oh sorry yes you can't write character character is formed by a group of characteristics  student: okey, i got it. thanks",3,2
22410,43,"teacher: ok cool - so final answers for the record = 1. my father passed on his love of fishing to me and my brother.. 2. our personalities are fixed perhaps not from birth but certainly when we reach adulthood. 3. beethovens musical talent was innate he could compose symphonies from the age of four! 4. honesty and kindness are very important qualities. 5. its very difficult or perhaps impossible to alter your character your genes play a very significant role. are you able to copy and paste from this box <student>? i mean without writing with a pen  student: not easily, but i will practice to remember them in my mind",3,3
22411,43,teacher: ok fine - i'll consider using material that i can maybe send you in an email first ok? it might be easier for you...  student: yes that great i think it can be easier too thanks,3,2
22412,43,"teacher: so <student> if you can, write a two-sentence introduction for the original essay question from earlier today ok? don't worry too much about 'difficult' words ok? just be direct and clear if you can....remember the question&gt; here it is: our personalities are predetermined as a result of our genes and there is nothing we can do to change them. to what extent do you agree? i'll give you a couple of minutes ok? remember: one background sentence and one 'thesis sentence!  student: okey",3,1
22413,43,"teacher: ok  student: it is argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter it. although i strongly agree whit that genes play a significant role, learning afterward is more important.",1,3
22414,43,"teacher: ok thanks a lot <student> - you've really tried to copy the idea of the model we look at before with ielts introductions in general and i think that's great so well done you might feel this is too short/simple but trust me it;s a good start!  student: okey, thanks a lot",3,1
22415,43,"teacher: good use of keywords too.... so it is argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter _____ (plural pronoun?!). although i strongly agree whit ('with' + noun - do you need it here? )that genes play a significant role, learning afterward is more important. significant role' + good too by the way! sorry = good i wanted to say  student: it is argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter our qualities. although i strongly agree with it that genes play a significant role, learning afterward is more important.",3,2
22416,43,"teacher: ok thanks <student>, so here's the two little changes i sas thinking of and also a suggestion for developing the end a little bit: it is sometimes argued that our characteristics are fixed and we are not able to alter them. although i strongly agree that genes play a significant role, our learning and experience after birth is more important in forming our personalities. ok?!!  student: yes,that is perfect",3,1
22417,43,teacher: so in other words 'them' instead of 'it' (because characteristics is plural) and delete 'with' because you're using a subject/verb structure so you on'y need : i agree that..... but a good intro overall <student> - you;re on the right track ok?  student: i think writing in this way is more academic than i wrote before.,3,2
22418,43,"teacher: ok fine - i guess that's it for today <student> - thanks. so i'll speak to you tomorrow from 14:00 ...bye  student: okey,bey",3,1

22431,231,"student: i can't seem to find it  teacher: you should have it in a sec it should be page 16 for you i think. trouble is, the page count in my pdf reader is different from online!",3,3
22432,231,"student: do we start with part 4?  teacher: part 3, please! i don't think we did part 3",3,2

22436,231,student: evolving  teacher: evolutionary,1,1

22439,231,"student: thank you next?  teacher: yes, please! your favourite",2,2
22440,231,"student: the next one is tricky though ... 25 ??? 26 mira tried not to take sided in the argument between...  teacher: ok, in key word transformation task, you get 2 points for each number. even if you don't know the expression with 'way', it's worth scoring at least one point with the passive",3,3
22441,231,student: *take sides  teacher: 26. correct!,1,1
22442,231,student: ok passengers were instructed to make way down the bus  teacher: nearly! were instructed to make their way...:.,3,2
22443,231,"student: almost... 27 the carnival's success was under threat due to lack of support 28.... his decision was not open for discussion  teacher: hmm, could you check the tense, please? and an article is missing in 27",3,1
22444,231,"student: oh sure. sorry is under threat due to the lack  teacher: yes, correct!",3,2
22445,231,student: 29 no matter how late it'll be .... 30 i just caught a sight .a glimpse?. of emma  teacher: the tense again in 29.,2,2

22447,231,"student: the present tense  teacher: yes, you hardly ever need to change the tense in key word transformation!",3,2
22448,231,"student: ok. then. no matter how late it is caught sight of -- noted  teacher: in fact, this is one of the things to watch out for, whether it's the same tense .or similar, both present / past / future. and one last for 28: was not open to further discussion tricky, i know!",2,3
22449,231,"student: right. we need to keep as much original information as possible  teacher: yes, true! unlike in speaking and writing, you actually paraphrase as little as possible in speaking and writing, you're encouraged to paraphrase, to show that you can use a range of vocabulary, not just the words from the task",3,2
22450,231,"student: right. makes sense  teacher: ok! i actually thought we might practise some speaking questions today. again, with the aim to show off that lovely language!",3,3
22451,231,student: maybe more tests? =.  teacher: nooo! let's do something fun! my idea of fun :.,4,2
22452,231,"student: tests are fun for me speaking, however......  teacher: ha, i'm like that too, to be honest! as you probably know, a part of the speaking is a collaborative task where you discuss something with the other candidate and at least two parts are picture-based. an examiner gives you some pictures and asks questions based on them also, you will be expected to comment on the questions the other candidate is asked .not on their answers, thankfully!. but there are also some plain old question at the end, which give you a chance to speak on your own for a longer time",4,3
22453,231,"student: yes. i remember  teacher: even though some examiners invite an exchange of opinions between candidates as well at c2 level, they are quite abstract, the questions",3,1
22454,231,"student: right  teacher: the first part, however, are nice warm-up questions the examiner says, i'd like to find out something about you. where are you from? are you working or studying? .the traditional beginning of all cambridge english speaking exams it seems. and then something like what do you enjoy best about the place where you're living now? could you give me 2-3-4 nice sentences?",3,2
22455,231,"student: oh... it'll be tough  teacher: well, you can always say that at the moment, in lockdown, it's hard to think of things you enjoy - as long as you give a nice answer in terms of language, it doesn't even have to be truthful!",3,4
22456,231,"student: it would say the location, as my home is in the city center. it takes me 5 minutes to reach the nearest metro station. moreover, i can just walk to khreschatyk and avoid using any means of transport all-together. other perks include the vicinity of the botanical garden and other green zones. * i would say  teacher: lovely!",3,2
22457,231,"student: but trust me it would have been much more messy in speech it would be ....  teacher: hmm, i don't know if i believe you because i heard you speak and you're fluent..",3,3
22458,231,"student: when was it? i don't remember...  teacher: ok, next cambridge wants to know, how difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now? back when you just opened alma i believe!",3,2
22459,231,"student: by the way, does the exam panel assess accents? oh right! maybe at alias my memory has worsen quite a bit after maya's birth  teacher: it's absolutely fine to have an accent, everybody does .even the queen.. they assess intelligibility, the pronunciation / mispronunciation of individual words, sentence stress and intonation yes, it must have been a game of alias! i can't remember very clearly either so unless your accent impedes comprehension, you're fine! ok, so how difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now? .see what they are doing? eliciting conditionals and the language of speculation, like modals.",4,3
22460,231,"student: not difficult at all. you see, the advantages i've just provided cannot overrule the disadvantages of my residential area. they are poor air quality, noise pollution, forlorn playgrounds and shabby infrastructure. so i'd move in no time. overrule or maybe override  teacher: perfect! great answer override would be better, i agree!",3,2
22461,231,student: it took me a while because i forgot how to spell forlorn although i know how to pronounce it  teacher: you wouldn't have this problem in the speaking test!...,3,1
22462,231,"student: right. that's what i thought  teacher: yes, the centre of kyiv is so lovely and green, but not without its challenges, is it?",2,2
22463,231,"student: indeed yesterday, we travelled to nyvky there's a residential area called fayna town  teacher: oh yes, i stayed there for a month while doing celta that must be new",3,3
22464,231,"student: it's perfect in terms of air quality and infrustructure but the commute it tiring to say the least at peak hours around 2 hrs now  teacher: i remember lots of fresh fruit and vegetables at the market and a giant park ooh, horrible!",3,4
22465,231,"student: yes. the area is wonderful our friends live there they've just bought an apartment  teacher: are there nice schools, too?",3,2
22466,231,"student: their daughter goes to a school on arsenalna street so i guess, no good schools  teacher: that's faraway, isn't it? from nyvky ah, yes, that makes sense",3,1
22467,231,"student: yes, arsenalna is near alma school  teacher: yes, i thought so",2,0
22468,231,"student: ok. it's time already i think  teacher: here in the uk, while kids are small, all house moves are dominated by the catchment area of schools. i bet it's universal though, for all families, not just in the uk, obviously",2,2
22469,231,"student: next monday same time?  teacher: yes, i've got to let you go! yes, sure, same time on monday!",3,0

22583,188,"teacher: well, hybrids use less petrol, so they are both economical and better for the planet  student: ok! so. it takes lots of sources to make the energy for electric cars",3,3
22584,188,"teacher: yes, but it doesn't have to be from fossil fuels! one day it could even be solar energy if something is economical, it saves you money. or if a person is economical, they are good at saving money economical car, economical person but! an economic crisis; economic growth  student: yes! i mean than now the hybrids could be even better for the environment ah! i like the words economical and economic",4,3
22585,188,"teacher: yes, i like them too :)  student: it's same in ukrainian and russian",2,1
22586,188,"teacher: yes, of course it is! i haven't thought about it, weirdly, but you're right!  student: i think in ukrainian we have two so different words",2,2
22587,188,teacher: but in russian the short word means 'economical' and the long one means 'economic'))  student: zaoshchadlivyi and economichnyi,3,3
22588,188,"teacher: ah, yes, of course, that's a good word!  student: and the long one means 'economic')) - sure!! )",4,2
22589,188,"teacher: ok, next word! at the moment, one of the problems with electric cars is that there aren't many charge points you know, a special plug where you can charge your electric car if you have a garage or a driveway, you can have your own charge point  student: yes! i know that it's a big problem for drivers actually",3,3
22590,188,"teacher: if you have your own garage or driveway, it means you have 'off-street parking'  student: driveway?",3,1
22591,188,"teacher: you don't have to park you car in the street you know, in front of some english houses there is a space for a car a driveway  student: ah! i see",2,2
22592,188,teacher: *there is space  student: it's not a garage. but a special place here in kyiv we usually have parkings,3,3
22593,188,"teacher: yes, we haven't got one :) we have a front garden instead, but our neighbours haven't got a front garden, they have a driveway. they are more practical people :) yes, of course, you have car parks  student: haha ) could you leave your cat on the street? it's not against the rules?",3,4
22594,188,"teacher: ok, a couple more words and i'll leave you with some homework :)  student: sorry, car not cat ))))",3,3
22595,188,"teacher: yes, we can park on the street! but of course, there is competition. you know, who gets to this space first :) not cat)))  student: yes! it's tight game )",4,4
22596,188,"teacher: ok! our next word is 'a bonnet'. it's a part of a car that covers the engine ha, yes, it is!  student: don't leave your cat on the street ))",3,3
22597,188,"teacher: oh, there are so many cats around who live a half-wild life and hunt charity protected birds but back to cars! it's important for a driver to have an idea about what goes on under the bonnet things like that  student: under the bonnet , ? ah, ok i see",2,2
22598,188,teacher: a bonnet = a metal cover over the engine  student: to know how the car works ),3,1
22599,188,teacher: kapot??? i'm not sure  student: kapot! yes! ) bonnet isfrench word?,3,3
22600,188,"teacher: ha, that's interesting! just like kapot, a bonnet also means an old-fashioned women's hat. you know, the one that covers ears babies wear bonnets too oh, good question. it might be a french word, but it's pronounced bn.t not in a french way  student: ok! i see! <teacher>! it's time! i guess you have to go )",3,2
22601,188,teacher: i'm ok! do you have to go?  student: i'm sorry for being late!,2,1
22602,188,teacher: no worries  student: we can continue next week ) thank you very much for the lesson and your patience ),3,2
22603,188,"teacher: ok, i'm going to send you your homework in messenger, ok? have a lovely weekend! you're very welcome :)  student: you too! thank you! xx bye! )",3,3
35683,219,student: hello!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?,3,1
35684,219,"student: good thank you. how about you?  teacher: all good, thanks! have you had the time to do the reading part?",3,2
35685,219,"student: i had time to do the first exercise and part of the second one... so better than nothing i guess ;.  teacher: ok, sure! absolutely! how did you find the tasks?",3,3
35686,219,"student: well, i was expecting to solve them in less time, but you really need to read through them... i see that there are many sentences and expressions that aren't very common...i would say i managed to do a decent job anyway, but i guess i can ask you about a few expressions ;. anyway given the right amount of time i think they are not too hard :.  teacher: yes, they are deep-reading rather than scanning exercises. having said that, once you know how the task works and know what you're looking for, the process speeds up considerably .and we'll work on those techniquies.",3,4
35687,219,"student: i believe part 5 can be tricky...anway, i can copy paste the answers for that one, and some expressions i found difficult if you want  teacher: ok, shall we check the answers then? could you send me your answers to questions 31-36 .part 1. sorry, part 5! use of english and reading used to be two papers, i guess i'm still thinking of part 5 as reading part 1",3,2
35688,219,"student: 31. c, 32. c, 33. d., 34. b, 35. a .?. 36. c....i wasn't sure about a few answers, but particoularly about 35  teacher: ok, why did you go for a in 35?",3,3
35689,219,"student: to begin, i don't know the meaning of the expression: 'this was something of a plum', but i guess it means something along the lines 'this was a positive thing' .referred to her age.. i realize now that, if this is the case, probably c would be more suitable...  teacher: oh, a plum job is a good one, a job worth having",3,3
35690,219,"student: as the others are true but only because we have 'an outside view', while she doesn't know  teacher: aha, i see what you're saying. a plum doesn't mean an advantage here! yes, exactly, we need to say what she thought, 'on reflection' anyway, why did you choose a .it's the right answer, by the way.?",3,2
35691,219,"student: because she refuses to call it luck...and tries to find explanations not involving luck but some of her qualities .even the age.  teacher: could you find a phrase in the text that means 'because she deserved it'? it's that penultimate paragraph that starts with ''later,'",3,3
35692,219,"student: she must have got the job on her merits'  teacher: yes, absolutely! there is 'evidence' for each correct answer in the text. if a candidate is taking a paper-based version of the test, it might be useful to underline it for example, you would underline 'she must have got the job on her merits' and put '35' next to it",2,2
35693,219,"student: i see, that makes sense...especially when reviewing at the end .if there is time for it!.  teacher: yes, exactly, it makes reviewing at the end very easy! i won't be torturing you further and will just say that you got all the answers right :. but just for practice, could you find evidence in the text, for, say, number 32?",3,3
35694,219,"student: haha, okay great!  teacher: yes, very well done!",3,1
35695,219,"student: in this trade, she saw, you needed not so much to be abreast of things as ahead of them, lying in wait for circumstance, ready to pounce.' thank you  teacher: exactly! you get the idea :. what were you questions, anyway? *your",3,2
35696,219,"student: for example in this sentence i am not sure about the meaning of 'to be abreast of things'...and also the expression 'ready to pounce' is something new for me. i believe it means 'always ready to promptly deliver'...  teacher: oh, a cat pounces when it jumps onto its prey and grabs it or a big cat like a lion etc. :.",3,3
35697,219,"student: i see  teacher: and, if you and someone else are moving abreast, you are next to each other for example, in the uk, if you are cycling with your child, you are allowed to cycle abreast, with your child's bike between you and the pavement and cars aren't supposed to honk at you",4,2
35698,219,"student: hmm...wait, the pavement is the ground, right? i don't understand... the location of the child's bike  teacher: oh, sorry, the pavement is a part of a road where pedestrians go",3,3
35699,219,student: ohhh now it makes sense  teacher: sidewalk! it's what americans call 'sidewalk',2,2
35700,219,"student: i have to memorize this, pavement not sidewalk okay, now it makes sense!  teacher: haha, well, do your colleagues at work mostly use american english? and you lived in the us, i seem to remember oh no, was it south america though? yes, bikes aren't supposed to go on the pavement .but they do all the time. and parents and children are supposed to ride abreast .but they hardly every do.",4,3
35701,219,"student: i am in austria...my collegues are austrian so they don't speak natively i see, i don't know if in italy that's allowed *natively english  teacher: yes, sure shall we move on to the next part?",2,1
35702,219,"student: yes  teacher: ok, cool! which ones have you done?",3,2
35703,219,"student: 37. d, 38. h , 39. a...but to be honest i am sure only about the first one this is really a time-dependent task, and i didn't manage to read everything properly  teacher: ok, great. actually, with this task, you're looking for links between paragraphs. the text really is very big, but there are distinct links that can help to complete the task without reading everyting in-depth the first two are correct, let's try to find those links one second why is the first one d?",3,3
35704,219,"student: .i also think this is easier to do on paper as you can cross sentences you used and visually see what is remaning.  teacher: yes, definitely. but i think, if you happen to take the computer-based version of the test, you can drag-and-drop paragraphs, which is quite helpful visually",4,2
35705,219,"student: hmm...now that i am reading it i am not sure anymore i think it was the beginning: 'in times gone by, all seven islands...' and then the stories goes on in the paragraph 'sometime in the last century, the last of the trees on high ground were'  teacher: yes, exactly. the first paragraph: how spanish sailors found the canaries .flourishing agriculture.. paragraph 2 .d.: deforestation begins paragraph 3: the last of the trees are cut down also, .d. gives us the name of the island. in the first paragraph, it's just 'the canaries', and in paragraph 3 they are talking about 'the north of the island', so we're supposed to know which island it is something that d fills in for us",3,3
35706,219,"student: could 39. be f, since it talks about fog not touching the ground...and then there is a paragraph about fog harvesting? but i still have a problem with the previous paragraph talking about chile..  teacher: one sec, i'll look at 39 yes, correct! riebold explains why saplings died without fog harvesting by the way, to go back to 38, there is such a good link there. the next paragraph starts with 'these failed efforts', so you know that 38 needs to be the description of the failed efforts",3,4
35707,219,"student: oh, i didn't notice...but yes, i should have noticed that...  teacher: ok, we've got 37 d, 38 h, 39 f would you like to have a go at 40?",3,3
35708,219,"student: 40 b since the previous paragraph tells about the first project starting and in b you have some results of these first trials .2 liters collected, when 1 was enough.  teacher: yes, and also the following paragraph says 'having declared the initial project a success' .so we need a success story for 40. correct",3,4
35709,219,"student: .when 1 would have been enough...? are both these expression okay?.  teacher: 1 would have been enough .but they had two, so it's a conditional. vs. they collected 1 litre for each tree, and that was enough.",3,2
35710,219,"student: i see, okay thank you :.  teacher: no problem. 41?",1,1
35711,219,"student: i don't know...there is a line about irrigation which could be linked to farmers .and thus g.  teacher: ok, let's leave 41 for now. what about 42? there's a very clear link in the first sentence of the following paragraph",2,3
35712,219,student: 42 a the paragraph ends talking about a bigger project covering 50 square kilometers and a starts talking about a more ambitious scheme  teacher: but the knock-on effect of reviving the forest goes beyond restoring wildlife' which means that the paragraph should talk about... restoring wildlife,3,4
35713,219,"student: oh, in that case it's e  teacher: yes, correct!",2,1
35714,219,"student: then 43 is g, i guess, since the next paragraph begins with 'whether or not fog harvesting will prompt a large- scale return to agriculture'  teacher: i see what you're saying about 'this more ambitious scheme' with a, actually, but it doesn't work with the following paragraph absolutely, we finally get to the farmers in 43 so you've now used d, h, f, b, e and g the options for 41 are a and c",3,3
35715,219,"student: i guess c i guess it's c...but why...mm i don't see clear links to be honest  teacher: no, there aren't. c is suddenly a story about the past, doesn't really work here i've got to let you go, it's obviously a byt he process of elimination. if you have a minute to see why later on, that could be part of the homework, together with the last task if you have the time",3,2
35716,219,"student: okay, i will do that...i guess now i will take a break because i my mind i really a bit fogged ;. thank you for the lesson! have a nice week!  teacher: missing paragraphs' is probably the most challenging reading task, well done, you're almost there! you too, have a lovely week, speak to you next tuesday!",3,3
35718,77,teacher: hi there <student>...  student: hi <teacher>,1,0
35719,77,"teacher: i fear my internet might be a bit dodgy today but we'll hope for the best!  student: sorry, i'm late! i took me a few minutes to get here... my laptop is being very slow toda",3,2
35720,77,"teacher: ah that's ok....i'm having a few little problems too!  student: ah ok, no problem",2,1
35721,77,teacher: hey <student>...i think i might have mentioned to you the value of comments on internet forums etc for language learning?  student: not sure about it... tell me a bit more please,3,3
35722,77,"teacher: ok...well i've been looking at some for french and i've just been reminded o f what a rich source they are ...  student: do you recommend that forums to learn english? those, sorry",3,3
35723,77,"teacher: well i think taht for a more advanced learner they are, as i say, a really rich source of spoken-style language they contain a huge amount of authentic idiomatic language for esample and i;ve been looking at some in english to think about english teaching and it's confirmed this idea  student: it sounds very good i don't think we've talked about it before... could you mention the ones you know?",4,4
35724,77,teacher: but it's great because for example you get one youtube video and hundreds of comments and they all naturally use a whole range of language to describe the same thing you know? it's like a mini-corpus! yes nothing special - i just mean on e.g. youtube videos or newspaper websites (where they have comment sections after opinion pieces for example)  student: ahh now i see what you mean,3,3
35725,77,teacher: i was thinking about boris johnson coming out of intensive care after our previous discussion and i looked at the comments section on the youtube videos of his speech afterwards  student: i thought you were talking about forums like wordreference.com forum,3,2
35726,77,"teacher: ah right .. no , just real stuff!  student: i see",2,1
35727,77,"teacher: can i ask you to have a quick look at the youtube video now?  student: yes, sure... i like reading what english people write on my english friend's walls on facebook for example",3,2
35728,77,teacher: the search terms you need are: 'it could have gone either way boris johnson sky news - maybe just watch the first couple of minutes ok?  student: yes (about the video) i will watch it now,2,1
35729,77,"teacher: right yes...facebook is a good source i'm sure ok! actually, he starts thanking individuals after a couple of minutes which is quite funny!  student: i watched the first 2 minutes yes, thanking everyone for not organising barbecues in the park",3,2
35730,77,"teacher: ok! so you get the idea....he gets more personal later, thanking individual nurses etc (ironically they're immigrants!) i wonder <student> - is this similar to what a spanish politician would do?  student: yes i know, i saw him on the spanish news talking about his hero 'a portuguese nurse'",3,3
35731,77,"teacher: ah right ok! well anyway, i was looking at the comments section afterwards and i;ve edited some examples for you....  student: great!",3,1
35732,77,"teacher: here are the first 5 .... my quick overall question first is: which one supports boris? 1. maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - i'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. it was only ever going to go one way lol 3. im so glad youre ok mr johnson. i shouted yes! when i heard you were discharged from hospital. youre the best prime minister we have had. caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. truly admirable. please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! you deserve it. 4. you actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. i hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious nhs and other public services. 5. what a load of bollocks, knew hed recover straight away  student: haha a variety of opinions",3,2
35733,77,teacher: yes! great though right? so much rich language .... and quite similar to real speaking a lot of it....  student: yes i didn't konw you could use the word 'bugger' to call a person,3,3
35734,77,"teacher: ok so as you can imagine most of the people posting comments are critical! only one is unequivocally pro-boris right? yes...a bugger! a little bit old-fashioned perhaps (and not that rude any more) ok <student> so a few language questions for you if you're ready...  student: ahh good! i thought it was an expression, something like 'shit!' yes, i'm ready!",3,4
35735,77,"teacher: yes, you;re right ... it;s that too like if you;re hurt yourself/forget something for example (bit less rude than shit)  student: i see",3,2
35736,77,"teacher: can you find a word/phrase in the 5 comments with the following meaning? theyre in the right order by the way): a) get better/not die! b) allowed to leave hospital c) generous d) unpleasant and prolonged experience e) brief contact with something unpleasant f) rubbish 1. maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - i'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. it was only ever going to go one way lol 3. im so glad youre ok mr johnson. i shouted yes! when i heard you were discharged from hospital. youre the best prime minister we have had. caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. truly admirable. please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! you deserve it. 4. you actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. i hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious nhs and other public services. 5. what a load of bollocks, knew hed recover straight away  student: a) pull through",3,3
35737,77,teacher: ok great  student: not sure about the meaning of the second one... does that person mean that being the prime minister he had to survive??,2,2
35738,77,teacher: ah yes good question - this is a bit ambiguous....  student: b)to be discharged from hospital (you taught me that one a few days ago ;),3,3
35739,77,"teacher: most neutral meaning = just chances are he wouldn't die statistically you know?  student: yes, i get that person is being ironical, am i right? number 2",3,2
35740,77,teacher: or maybe the person wanted him to die but was pessimistic about his wish coming true! yes i think probably ironic yes yes 'discharge' good recycing!  student: c) selfless,3,1
35741,77,teacher: ok good  student: d)ordeal (don't know this word),3,2
35742,77,"teacher: yes - i guessed this might be a new word  student: ahh, i thought it was an old-fashion word",3,3
35743,77,"teacher: right - i meant new for you by the way! well, it's a bit more formal than some of the other words/phrases here but normal....  student: e) close brush ( i like this one! brush like in tooth brush)",3,2
35744,77,teacher: yes this is a good one - and normal! close shave = same meaning  student: haha i understood it was a popular word nowadays,3,3
35745,77,teacher: yes i guess... actually close brush and close shave not totally the same i;ll come back to that in a bit...  student: okk f) bollocks,2,2
35746,77,"teacher: ok thanks! a bit vulgar obviously but very common! often 'rubbish; in the sense of 'nonsense' rather than low-quality  student: i see there is another very similar word i don't remember now, very common for the same thing",3,3
35747,77,"teacher: trying to think...'crap' maybe?  student: ahhh bullshit, sorry if it is too rude, i don't know",3,4
35748,77,"teacher: ok yes you;re right...no don't worry about being rude, it's all in the interests of science! not that rude anyway these days... by the way , in order of register it's the following: 1. rubbish 2. crap 3. shit or various alternatives for each category obviously i.e. 1. nonsense 3. bollocks etc  student: what do you mean?? from less rude to more rude??",3,3
35749,77,teacher: yes exactly do you have the word 'register' in spanish to indicate formality/informality?  student: thank you! that's very useful... it's hard when you learn these kind of words i don't think we have a word 'register',3,2
35750,77,"teacher: yes sure....it;s the use rather than the basic meaning which gets harder as you get more advanced of course...  student: the problem i think is that you don't learn them at school, generally you pick them up from people",3,3
35751,77,teacher: ok well in linguistics it just means the variety of language you;re using (e.g. vocab/grammar/pronunciation) often measured in terms of formality  student: so it's difficult to know if they are terrible or not,3,1
35752,77,"teacher: high' register = more formal yes i see - well, that's where you;re time actually spent in the uk is so useful i guess  student: yes, i think so",3,2
35753,77,"teacher: sorry <student> , before i forget .... close brush with soemthing (often death!) whereas 'a close shave' basically comes after the dangerous thing (and bigger variety of things possible than with 'brush') has been mentioned...ok?!  student: yes",1,1
35754,77,"teacher: e.g. we nearly crashed! yes, it was a close shave. ok!  student: i see, thanks",3,2
35755,77,teacher: fancy having a look at another set of comments quickly?  student: sure!!,3,1
35756,77,"teacher: ok hold on a sec 1. let's hope that this has been an eye-opener for him, and he realises the nhs staff need better care in the future 2. its reassuring to know, when this problem is over, our politicians will still feel so appreciative of the nhs and our other support services and translate their thanks into hard cash. 3. jeez looks like hes lost two stone 4. im happy for boris no matter what your politics no one wishes anyone to die that way. now you are better boris give the nurses more money please. 5. you need to invest money and reopen hemel hospital accident and emergency. questions if you have time! : who supports boris the most?! who has a complaint about a local problem? who is the most sarcastic? who mentions his physical appearance?  student: number 3 talks about his physical appearance",3,2
35757,77,teacher: ok!  student: number 5 talks about a local problem,2,1
35758,77,teacher: yep  student: the most sarcastic i think it is number 2?,1,2
35759,77,teacher: yes absolutely! classic british example - i could have written that myself!  student: haha nobody here seems to suport boris heres but maybe number 4?,3,3
35760,77,"teacher: yes i guess 'support' is not quite the right word! i've reduced these ti be quick... a) something surprising that you learn from b) change something to a new form - especially a plan or something more abstract into something (more) real c) us __ d) if you want to ask someone if they are left-wing or right -wing you can ask: what are your _________.?  student: well, this one said i'm happy",4,1
35761,77,"teacher: yes! 1. let's hope that this has been an eye-opener for him, and he realises the nhs staff need better care in the future 2. its reassuring to know, when this problem is over, our politicians will still feel so appreciative of the nhs and our other support services and translate their thanks into hard cash. 3. jeez looks like hes lost two stone 4. im happy for boris no matter what your politics no one wishes anyone to die that way. now you are better boris give the nurses more money please. 5. you need to invest money and reopen hemel hospital accident and emergency. can you manage those in a few mintues?! see how you go....  student: no, that's too hard for 2 minutes sorryyy",2,2
35762,77,"teacher: ok i'll leave them with you for next time ok?  student: yes, please!! thank you very much again!",3,1
35763,77,teacher: ok no problem speak to you on tuesday - have a good one!  student: you too!! bye,3,0
35765,30,teacher: hi <student> - are you there?!  student: hi <teacher>,1,0
35766,30,"teacher: hi, how are you doing?  student: how do you say 'passing the days'?? do you have an expression for that?",4,2
35767,30,teacher: um...not really i guess the translation could be ...e.g. 'surviving' or 'getting by'  student: exactly that... surviving how about you?,3,3
35768,30,teacher: well...surviving i guess! i'm at home now and basically 'social distancing' is the new norm so pretty limited also i hurt my knee which is annoying (poor me)  student: finally!!,3,1
35769,30,"teacher: yes finally although not enforced as yet....  student: ohh yes, poor you! is it serious?",3,3
35770,30,teacher: well i hope not - i've had a couple of operations before (sports injuries) but it might not be tat bad ...just gotta wait and see but i go a bit crazy without movement you know  student: hope you get better soon,3,2
35771,30,"teacher: yeah thanks - it's ok - mind over matter - i;m serious you know? it's a good mental test as in it's the way you look at things right?  student: yes, i know what you mean... i feel the same. i just went to exercise a bit inside my building but we're not suppose to...",3,3
35772,30,"teacher: not even inside? you mean on the stairs or something?  student: no :(. i don't understand why not. i just talked to one of my neighbours and he told me (in a good way) that if i do it, everyone would do it too. and i really think that we could plan a half and hour-walk for everyone during the day... half-and-hour-walk?",3,4
35773,30,teacher: a half-hour walk (you mean 30 minutes right?)  student: hehe i see,2,1
35774,30,teacher: and how about a simlar phrase for 90 minutes? can iyou try it?  student: we could have a ninety-minute walk ??,3,3
35775,30,teacher: yes fine thanks just checking! yes you'd think there'd be a way to manage soemthing  student: thank you!! it's so different in spanish,3,2
35776,30,"teacher: sure i remember having problems the other way round hey <student>...are you still planning (or did you do) to do a cae exam?  student: i'm sure... i think it's important that we go out a bit for our mental and fisical health fisical health is not right, how do you say it?",3,3
35777,30,"teacher: yes i agree - mental health is important - oh sure physical! although often when we mean physical health we just say 'health' of course shows you the bias towards that side of things  student: about the cae exam, a month ago i decided to postpone it. i was doing too many things and i was very stressed... i couldn't sleep well. so i decided to postpone what wasn't urgent",4,4
35778,30,teacher: yes i see - sounds like it was a good idea - i guess it's not possible to do the exams at the moment anyway...  student: i suddenly now i have soooo much free time... haha live is showing us that we shouldn't plan so much,3,3
35779,30,teacher: yes that's true....i guess we've been pampered for decades  student: sure,2,1
35780,30,teacher: we can't cope without our routines... and the state doing lots of things for us  student: but it'd be great (if you want) to keep looking at cae exercises,3,2
35781,30,teacher: not that i'm complaining exactly! yes of course we can do that if you like...  student: sure!! thanks,2,2
35782,30,teacher: i have the book with me - do you want to have a go now? page 130 for example?  student: me too :) no idea about 17,3,1
35783,30,teacher: ah ok - it's an adjective meanign they had influence - does that help?  student: let me think... influential??,3,3
35784,30,teacher: adjective endings.....-ive/-ous--ial ...choose one of these! yes you've got it - well done  student: great clues! thank you,4,2
35785,30,teacher: and you didn't say influencial which is a common spanish mistake  student: 18 inspiration,3,1
35786,30,teacher: yes good  student: 19 generosity,1,2
35787,30,teacher: great  student: 20 restless??,1,2
35788,30,teacher: yes right idea for the meaning = good but you need a noun i.e. the thing that led him... add a noun ending to your adjective  student: ness?,3,3
35789,30,teacher: yes that's right!  student: really?? restlessness?? i didn't know that word exists,3,4
35790,30,"teacher: yes really...e.g. hopelessness/restlessness/homelessness etc fearlessness! remember that with the schwa sound it's quick when people say it - maybe looks more weird that it sounds... or maybe not to you i don;t know!  student: i guessed it because yesterday i listened to a esther perel podcast called 'sexlessness'. do you know her? she is great, i think... she is a therapist",3,4
35791,30,"teacher: no i don't actually - but there you go - good extensive listening  student: yes, i see how important is to keep listening and reading things in english well, i'll continue",3,2
35792,30,teacher: yes it's the one thing really you can do  student: 21 medical,1,1
35793,30,teacher: yes good  student: 22 admiration,1,1
35794,30,teacher: fine  student: 23 enthusiasm,1,1
35795,30,teacher: yes good  student: no idea about 24 (is this sentence correct? is there a better way of saying that i don't know the answer??),3,2
35796,30,teacher: um you 'no idea about' is fine and common don't worry...apart from that...i haven't got a clue is common  student: okk,2,1
35797,30,"teacher: yes i guessed 24 would be tough - it's ;outcry' - have you seen that before?  student: no, never",3,1
35798,30,"teacher: it's like protest/controversy/opposition as the noun form of 'cry out' (in pain/anger etc) bit germanic i guess!  student: i understan, thanks",3,2
35799,30,teacher: there are lots of verbs/nouns with 'out' that don't come so easilly to mind for you perhaps  student: i'm sure...,2,1
35800,30,teacher: as in some will be in your passive knowledge but perhaps not used so much in my experience with e.g. italians/spanish/french etc for obvious reasons  student: can you give an example? i can't think of any,2,3
35801,30,teacher: yes sure ..hold on... so verbs first ...maybe a bit easier cos there are more perhaps so if i run faster than you ...i _______ you (one-word verb answer) ?  student: pass overtake ? not sure,3,3
35802,30,teacher: ah well possible i guess - as in the moment itself - but more generally we can say 'outrun' by the way overtake good idea and very common (but still only for the moment itself)  student: another new word for me!!,3,3
35803,30,teacher: lots of spanish speakers just say pass - good to have thought of overtake = very natural but yes 'outrun' = normal too so good to know what about e.g. score more points than?  student: no idea,3,1
35804,30,teacher: outscore! and: fight harder than?  student: outfight??,1,3
35805,30,"teacher: yes! be more than (in number)  student: but i don't know how to use these words!! for example, can i say 'my team outscored more points than yours'?",3,4
35806,30,"teacher: well for example....if mnachester united beat barcelona 5-0 then the sports report might say that they outfought, outran, outmuscled, outscored, outplayed barcelona any combination of these verbs! and others too!  student: i see",4,3
35807,30,"teacher: bit more formal than some phrases but still you'll hear these words a fair bit  student: so the example i wrote is not correct, is it?",3,2
35808,30,"teacher: by the way 'outnumber' was the last one - this is really common...as in e.g. males outnumber females in senior managemnt roles (or whatever!) sorry - which example are you saying wasn't correct?  student: i'll try to correct it... my team outscored yours last night before your examples, i wrote one",3,3
35809,30,teacher: oh sorry i see it now! yes you just need to say 'outscore' because this already includes the idea of 'points' this is why it's quite efficent you see! german!  student: now i got it... i think haha yes,3,2
35810,30,teacher: ok one more ...so apple has sold more devices than anyone else = apple has hugely _______ other tech companies  student: in germany then can still go out for walks with one person... i think they are much more sensible than spanish people...,2,1
35811,30,"teacher: yes i guess if you pick a limited number (or just one) of people and then stick with them it would be ok right? i feel bad because my daughter won't be able to play with her friends for months potentially this is the same in spain right? as in kids can't play with anyone? sorry i got sucked into the madness of the 'situation'  student: i actually don't know, maybe it's the right way to stop the virus but it's very hard for everyone...",3,2
35812,30,"teacher: yes - it'll be very difficult i'm sure - maybe people will start rebelling after a while i don;t know you know it's weird in the uk because we have no history of the state really being able to tell us what to do do you see?  student: about your daughter and children in general, i know it's really hard but then i think of children who live in siria for example where they can leave their houses because there are bombs and i think that we are lucky...",3,3
35813,30,"teacher: so e.g. the realtionship with the police is kind of contractual no of course you're right...it's all relative! i should take my own advice and change my perspective!  student: no, i think it's very normal... we are all confused and we all have contradictory ideas about everything at the moment... it's a very new situation but i think it'll take longer enough (unfortunately) to clarify our ideas sorry, about apple i don't know the answer!",2,2
35815,131,"student: hi, <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?",2,1
35816,131,"student: i'm fine, thank you  teacher: good to hear that!",2,1
35817,131,student: today i've buy a new coat ) how are you?  teacher: exciting! 'today i've ___ a new coat',3,3
35818,131,"student: ah, and new eyeshadows and two make-up brushes )) oh! sure! bought )  teacher: that's right! but good choice of tense, present perfect)) sounds like fun! i've heard the forecast is for another mild winter in ukraine",3,4
35819,131,"student: i was so exited to use it that i forgot to use right form of the verb ))  teacher: but this is the correct use, absolutely! apart from the verb)))",3,3
35820,131,"student: actually, i don't know really about the winter, but now it's quite warm for this time of the year  teacher: interesting! and a bit alarming",4,2
35821,131,"student: maybe it will be one more mild winter sure, alarming  teacher: at least it doesn't look like trump is getting a second term!",3,3
35822,131,student: i've checked today but it looked like on hold  teacher: even though the situation still remains pretty ____ (causing a lot of stress because of we don't know what's going to happen),4,1
35823,131,"student: like yesterday i mean tense )  teacher: correct! and if the two candidates are very close and we don't know who is going to win, they are ___ and ___",3,2
35824,131,"student: ) oh sorry neck and neck  teacher: yes, well done! :) i think just recently biden's made a good progress, so he is a little bit ahead now",3,3
35825,131,"student: sure will see  teacher: definitely! anyway, back to our difficult client who doesn't want to learn any grammar :)",4,2
35826,131,"student: now there are lots of memes about it  teacher: <teacher's husband>'s shown me some of those, yes!",3,3
35827,131,"student: like especially russian people are waiting for the results like babushkas and dedushkas discuss it )  teacher: well, they have had the same president for 20 years, basically",3,2
35828,131,"student: we've decided with <student's husband> that it's a bit about us ))) or trump in 'costume'of lukashenko  teacher: ooh, i haven't seen that!",3,3
35829,131,"student: maybe it's not so important thing ) <student's husband>'s shown me yesterday )  teacher: well, i think we're a bit like the babushkas from the memes, but also, this election does affect everyone!",3,4
35830,131,student: sure! ah! and have not just wins in my shopping  teacher: what do you mean?,2,2
35831,131,"student: ah victory i've ordered an advent calendar for <student's child> with paw patrol from the uk actuall y  teacher: haha, lovely!",3,3
35832,131,student: and then they've answered that they didn't have it on stock and now i have a toddler who wants it and i don't have a calendar )  teacher: oh no! that's very tense! :),3,2
35833,131,student: sure )  teacher: is it back in stock then?,2,1
35834,131,"student: i have the time till december ) i don't know. now it's out of stock  teacher: ah, i see! fingers crossed!",3,2
35835,131,"student: i meant that today i've had a good shopping but two day before it wasn't so lucky two days  teacher: ah, i'm with you now",2,2
35836,131,"student: can i use lucky not with a person?  teacher: i've just been thinking about that. you can, but in this sentence i would go for 'i wasn't so lucky two days ago' but we can say 'it was lucky that the eyeshadow i wanted was in stock' or 'it was unlucky that the advent calendar was out of stock'",3,3
35837,131,"student: it's clear now thank you  teacher: i've been doing some shopping two. i've already bought all my seeds for the next year because i'm worried that there will be a lot of demand for them again, because of coronavirus and brexit in the spring it was impossible to buy any seeds because of coronavirus in times of crisis, people suddently want to grow their own food",3,2
35838,131,"student: wow! and which seeds did you need?  teacher: so they bought out all the seeds well, i was ok because i had bought them well in advance, the previous summer :)",3,3
35839,131,student: haha  teacher: all my vegetables and some fruit,1,1
35840,131,"student: it's ukrainian mentality i think i like to have all in advance  teacher: i was thinking that, but maybe it's just human :)))",3,3
35841,131,student: maybe )  teacher: i didn't used to be like that but i am now!,1,2
35842,131,student: e too actually it's like an adult life )  teacher: maybe it's just a grown-up thing))),1,3
35843,131,student: sure )  teacher: exactly)) we were typing the same thought at the same time :) i like to have ___ in advance,3,2
35844,131,"student: ukrainian mentality? ))))  teacher: i would go for 'everything', not 'all' no, being an adult :))",2,1
35845,131,student: ah )))) sure everything actually what's the difference?  teacher: i have everything that i need. everything is so expensive these days. but you can't have it all.,2,2
35846,131,student: all more like an adjective?  teacher: there is an expression 'to have it all'. it often refers to having a career and a family a woman who has it all,3,2
35847,131,"student: ah, interesting!  teacher: yes, exactly, all doesn't work as a pronoun",3,1
35848,131,"student: it's clear, thank you!  teacher: except for 'all you need is love' :))",3,2
35849,131,"student: actually it was my main grammar rule ))  teacher: haha, i see!",3,1
35850,131,"student: and you subverted it ))  teacher: but we can say, 'we have everything we need here. the food and the internet connection :)'",3,2
35851,131,student: it's right using? but the internet at first )  teacher: definitely! and in some cases everything = all tell me all you know! tell me everything you know!,4,3
35852,131,student: i see ok  teacher: but 'everything' refers to 'things' more. i like to buy everything in advance,2,2
35853,131,"student: so we can use all as a pronoun if after it we have like description  teacher: yes, like 'all you need'",2,2
35854,131,"student: can i use all i like to buy is new clothes, for example?  teacher: yes, correct! you can't use everything there this is about all vs. every but that's easy, all singular",2,3
35855,131,student: thank you i will check it  teacher: sorry if it's confusing with all and everything! i can think of examples but it's hard to formulate a rule because sometimes they are the same and sometimes not :),3,2
35856,131,"student: sure as usual with the rules ))  teacher: yes, very often! let's go back to our difficult client who doesn't like grammar for a moment :) what's another word for an individual class?",3,3
35857,131,student: one-to-one )  teacher: yes! and if it's not online but is actually in a real classroom,3,2
35858,131,student: face-to-face )  teacher: well done!,3,1
35859,131,"student: good girl like <another teacher> told )  teacher: exactly))) i do wonder how he's doing now)) oh, and a few classes together can be a bundle / set of classes",2,2
35860,131,student: me too. i like him  teacher: i agree with <another student>!,2,1
35861,131,"student: i will tell to her )  teacher: or you can always say 'a course', of course a 25-hour course, for example",3,2
35862,131,"student: oh, it's a good option! tell to? or say to?  teacher: tell someone / say good girl as <another teacher> said",3,3
35863,131,"student: no to?  teacher: you can use say to, as in <another teacher> said to me that ....",3,2
35864,131,"student: ah, ok!  teacher: or: he told me that (no to)",2,2
35865,131,"student: clear!  teacher: you have to use an object with 'tell', but you can use 'say' with or without an object",2,3
35866,131,student: shame on me ) how many times i've checked ir it  teacher: no shame! it's a shame-free class),3,2
35867,131,"student: i check and forget every time )  teacher: a very quick look at your writing from the last time! you were well prepared for the question about no grammar :) dear <teacher>, thank you for your question. we completely understand you, so we need to make you sure that our teaching method is about communication - it's communicative method all our teachers use it for making students communicate easily. on our lesson you will speak a lot and to learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your usual life here in ukraine at the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers",3,1
35868,131,student: aha  teacher: i have a bit of a problem with 'we need to make sure' it sounds like it's something you've decided you need to do in the future rather than something you're already offering your clients,3,2
35869,131,student: ah  teacher: i would suggest 'let me assure you',3,1
35870,131,"student: should i use different expression? assure? ah, i see  teacher: let me assure you that our teaching method is all about communication",3,2
35871,131,student: make someone sure  teacher: let me assure you = let me show why you don't need to worry about it yes!,3,2
35872,131,"student: so need is more about future? because in russian it's ok to use it to use it in this case  teacher: well, if i say, i need to buy an advent calendar, it's nearly december",3,3
35873,131,"student: clear! thank you  teacher: it's present simple, but i'm talking about something i'm planning to do we need to use the communicative method' sounds like we aren't using it at the moment :)",3,2
35874,131,"student: aha, i see  teacher: then i would change 'make students communicate' to 'help students communicate'",3,1
35875,131,"student: sure agree it's better  teacher: aha, cool same sentence, we use something to vinfinitive all out teachers use it to help students communicate better",3,2
35876,131,"student: i see  teacher: ah, we are out of time! we'll start with this on wednesday, ok? have a lovely weekend!",3,1
35877,131,student: ! sure!  teacher: well done for learning all the new words :),3,2
35878,131,student: see you thank you have a good weekend!  teacher: thanks :) bye!,2,1
35880,36,teacher: hi <student>!  student: hi <teacher>,1,0
35881,36,teacher: hey there - sorrry give me a minute - go to relight my fire...  student: sure,1,1
35882,36,"teacher: ok the kindling has caught this time... i sit warm where you are at the moment? is it warm i mean!  student: sorry, i don't understand... kindling??",3,2
35883,36,"teacher: ah yes sorry - it's the name for the little bits of wood or whatever you use to start the fire at the beginning  student: here 18 degrees now, during the day it's very sunny",3,3
35884,36,teacher: nice....yes it's actually really sunny this week here too - and maybe....13 degrees!  student: not too bad 13!!,3,2
35885,36,"teacher: yes! actually my boat gets warm in the sun so it doesn't really matter about the outside temperatrue... have you heard of the amazon 'kindle' the thing for reading ebooks  student: that's good! i always imagined that boats were cold, so i was wrong yes, i know what a kindle is! i prefer books but i see how convenient a kindle can be...",3,3
35886,36,teacher: well they can be in a way - they're kind of a cross between a car and a house you know? as in they don't retain heat very well but hey warm up quickly  student: i see,3,1
35887,36,teacher: yes i just mentioned it because it struck me that it's related to the idea of kindling you see? because you kindle a flame - in this cae the flame of knowledge... you kindle a feeling in this case  student: ahh interesting...,4,2
35888,36,"teacher: it's related to 'candle' by the way as you can imagine so <student>...inversion....  student: now i know but before you explained i didn't! thanks yes, inversion!!",3,3
35889,36,"teacher: ok....so we use it for with a limited number of phrases/words - basically negative adverbs - to make something limited or emphatic.... for example....the word never (a limiting word let's say...) hold on i have never seen such a terrible sight = never have i seen such a ...you see?  student: i have a question about something you wrote yesterday. in the sentence 'not only do i like chocolate i also like cake', do we need to write 'do'??",3,4
35890,36,teacher: yes we do! hold on....  student: i understand the example with never,3,1
35891,36,"teacher: ok that's good/... with the present simple v, and past simple verbs we need auxiliary verb do/did and also make the main verb the infinitive ... for example....hold on not only does he love chocolate... i.e. he + love not loves  student: ok i didn't know we need auxiliary in affirmative sentences",3,2
35892,36,teacher: one last example: he only realised later that ... = only later did her realise that... yes not normally - but inversion is a special case  student: i see,2,1
35893,36,"teacher: although <student> you know of course that we sometimes say e.g. i do like chocolate right?  student: yes, i know that... but it is different, isn't it??",3,3
35894,36,teacher: in fact i could have written: you know that we do sometimes say i do like...  student: in i do like chocolate i can remove 'do' but in inversion we can't (if i understood well),3,4
35895,36,teacher: yes that's true of course..  student: okk,2,0
35896,36,teacher: i guess it's a bit similar in the sense that it's related to emphasis  student: i see,3,1
35897,36,teacher: sorry i can't resist: i could have written e.g. you do know that we do sometimes say i do like chocolate?  student: do do do do do do haha,3,3
35898,36,teacher: 3 extra do's in one sentence  student: from now i'll use 'do' all the time,3,2
35899,36,"teacher: yes - and actually not really exaggerated - we might really say that and it wouldn't sound strange go for it! seriously, it's much more common than we think...  student: same with did??",4,3
35900,36,"teacher: it's not always accompanied by a big dramatic tone/gesture/statment  student: i mean, is it also common??",3,2
35901,36,teacher: yes the same in the past and common  student: ok,1,1
35902,36,teacher: for example we often just use it to draw attention to something not in a big dramatic way for example...i did want to go out later (actually)  student: i see,3,2
35903,36,teacher: just a gentle way of suggesting that even though maybe it's late/we're busy or whatever (not always stated) i still wan tto go out some of the phrases we invert by the way are pretty formal but not all formal ones = for example: scarcely/seldom/little more normal: not only/only then  student: are these the adverbs that go at the beginning??,3,3
35904,36,teacher: yes exactly..so e.g. seldom have i been so impressed by blah blah e.g. little did he think that he would meet him again i think <student> if you listen to more formal speaking (or read stuff like that) you'll notice it more know  student: i'll pay more attention from now...,3,2
35905,36,"teacher: notice it more now' i mean - now that your attention has been drawn to it  student: yes, i knew what you meant",3,1
35906,36,teacher: yeah - it's interesting - because it's one of those 'grammar' things that doesn;t really change the meaning so you can basically not notice it and it doesn't really matter i.e. that's why people don't notice it  student: i'm surprised but i don't remember studying that at all... maybe i did and i've forgotten about it,3,2
35907,36,teacher: maybe you were away that lesson! it is something that's often covered quite quickly and in a self-contained kind of way  student: maybe... just to clarify...,3,1
35908,36,teacher: ah - did you see my auxiliary there? i did that one without thinking (e.g. it is something that's covered...) yes go ahead you'd hear the difference in speaking (i.e. emphatic) easily  student: if the inverted sentence (do you call them like this) is in past simple we use did and if it is in present simple we use do,3,2
35909,36,teacher: yes and yes ('inverted' =correct and do/did for present/past respectively)  student: and...,3,1
35910,36,"teacher: yep...  student: if it's in present simple you don't use auxiliary but you invert the order (have he...) but for present or past simple you don't invert the order (did he think...) sorry, i meant present perfect simple when i wrote the example (have he...)",3,3
35911,36,teacher: ah right i see hold on...  student: am i right?? i deduced that from your examples but no idea...,3,2
35912,36,"teacher: well, in the present perfect the auxiliary is 'have' right? so, e.g. not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied blah blah same idea in the present = not only does he steal from me he...ok? nice verb 'deduced' by the way!  student: i see!! have is the auxiliary...",3,3
35913,36,teacher: yes that's it  student: deduce: deducir en espaol ;),2,1
35914,36,"teacher: yeah i guess that's an easy one then! is it formal in spanish?  student: it's not really formal, we use it a lot...",2,2
35915,36,teacher: oh right - it's a bit formal in english educated' or whatever  student: and do you have an informal word for that?,3,3
35916,36,teacher: some people might never say it i guess...  student: maybe 'guess'?,2,2
35917,36,"teacher: um ..well i guess like lots of these things it would be replaced by a phrasal verb often - so e.g. work out or guess of vourse yes but 'work out' is maybe best here i just mean more common  student: ok, thanks could we practise the inverted sentences a bit?",3,3
35918,36,"teacher: because it's like a little process you know? 'guess' i soften just a quick little or one-step thing yes sure - i'll give you a prompt ok? unless you have an idea of your own first?  student: sure, i see the difference between guess and work out. i sometimes struggle to use phrasal verbs because i don't know where to write the thing i worked out... maybe we could talk about that another day, sorry (mixing topics)",3,4
35919,36,"teacher: yes! well most are 'separable' so e.g. work out something or work something out = both correct  student: about a prompt, yes please ahhh, i thought there was a rule about it!!",3,3
35920,36,teacher: ok so e.g.: i haven't had so much fun since i was in spain. can you invert that?  student: little fun have i had since i was in spain??,2,2
35921,36,teacher: yes i see your idea...start with 'not since...'  student: it's difficult!!!,3,3
35922,36,teacher: so it's the 3-word negative bit you've got to ivert invert imean e.g. i haven;t had not since i was...  student: not since i was in spain haven't i had so much fun not sure!,2,4
35923,36,teacher: yes good! you've already got the negative with 'not' at the beginning though so: 'haven't i had'?  student: not since i was in spain have i had so much fun??,3,3
35924,36,teacher: yes exactly ...you made your first little baby inversion....  student: ufff very hard... i get very stressed when i see hard new things... omg there are so many things to learn about a language... thank you very much for your time and your patience!,3,4
35925,36,"teacher: yes it's infinite that's true! keep calm and carry on - you know loads! ok thanks <student> i guess that's it for today - see you tomorrow bye no problem cheers  student: yes, see you tomorrow! bye",3,2
35927,127,student: hi!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you? all good?,3,1
35928,127,"student: how were your vacations?  teacher: we had a lovely time not doing very much at all, thank you. a good book, lots of baking, a bit of gardening and halloween! are you under the lockdown yet in austria? we will be as of thursday",3,4
35929,127,"student: it is a semi-lockdown, yes...it mostly involves a curfew and, for me, the fact that i now work from home 100% of the time.  teacher: are non-essential businesses shut though? how do you find working from home?",3,3
35930,127,"student: yes, non-essential business are closed, and there are limitations for bars and restaurants... i find it okay, but it is though sometimes with the children screaming all around me (i have two small children, of 2 years and ten months...)  teacher: i see! it's stricter in the uk in this case as i think bars and restaurants have to shut unless they deliver food",3,2
35931,127,"student: no, in austria too they can only deliver food..and after 20 no one should be on the street  teacher: oh, i didn't realize you had young kids! yes, definitely a busy parenting period",3,3
35932,127,"student: unless for medical reason...but bars and restaurants must be closed.  teacher: ah, yes, same idea, i see!",3,2
35933,127,"student: i have never told you before ;) i would say that, by italian standards, having a university degree and 2 children at my age is not that common...  teacher: no, that's why i assumed you didn't have a family! as always, don't assume!!",2,3
35934,127,"student: i see...avoid questions that might be problematic, that's a good idea.  teacher: yes, i don't usually start asking people about their families in the first class :) do you mostly speak german at work? or english? or italian?",4,2
35935,127,"student: i see...well, i guess you now know the most relevants parts of my life ;) i mostly speak english, because my collegues won't talk german with me until i can fluently speak it. but i sometimes use german too...and, since we have many people coming from abroad, i also practise my spanish from time to time ;)  teacher: yes, i have a 5-year-old boy, he started school in september, and the government is trying to keep schools open this time around. we'll see how that works!",3,3
35936,127,"student: while at home we speak only italian...maybe sometimes english since all the movies we watch are in english...  teacher: that's nice, that you can switch between languages so easily in your household",3,2
35937,127,"student: i remember you talking about a child...here they are trying to do that too...the children are starting to go do a 'tagesmutter' (essentially a baby sitter at home, who can take up to 4 children and is inserted into the social system through financial aids etc.), but now they are home again since the tagesmutter might have covid lukily my wife is still home, so she can take care of the kids, at least to an extent...  teacher: it's a 'childminder' in english. do the kids like it? at the childminder's i mean",4,3
35938,127,"student: (i am still here, there was a connection problem so the chat thought there were two <students> logged in)  teacher: oh yes, it does that, i can see you had to re-enter a couple of times",3,1
35939,127,"student: i see...never heard this term before: in italian it doesn't exist at all...they love it! she is a very nice girl, and has two children who love to play with our children. and it is also good for them: this way they can learn german...  teacher: oh wonderful, so it's just her children and yours then? here too, childminders have a limit on how many children they can look after and they are 'competitively priced', that is they are usually no more expensive than a nursery/ pre-school and you can use your funded hours towards fees",4,3
35940,127,"student: for now yes...actually her children go to school so in the morning they currently are alone, but a new child might come. actually, there was an attempt but the child's mother was too protective: a child of almost two years who wouldn't eat anything solid, not even a banana... here they are a bit more expensive than nursery, but we couldn't get into nursery because my wife is unenployed (she received just now the recognition of her degree to work here as a nurse). and there is some priority list: so we were excluded because of the number limit which, i believe, was reduced also because of covid.  teacher: so if a parent isn't working, the family might be refused a place at a nursery? but that's a vicious circle, they will never be able to start work then! here they are a bit more expensive than nursery; and there is some priority list",4,2
35941,127,"student: indeed...we also wrote something about my wife looking for a job as soon as she received the proper papers...but still, at least there are childminers.  teacher: could you have a look at these parts of sentences? some articles are missing",2,1
35942,127,"student: here they are a bit more expensive than a nursery...i believe...  teacher: yes, sure! i know with 'some' you probably mean 'some kind of a', right?",3,1
35943,127,"student: as for the second one i am not sure...maybe: 'and there is some list of priorities', but this would change the meaning a bit... oh, yes indeed, there is some kind of a priority list, that would be okay. what i wrote was more of a word-by-word translation from italian...  teacher: you can say colloquially, 'there's some list somewhere' or something like that, so it's not terribly wrong, just you seem to stick to quite formal english, and it stood out for me ah, that would explain it, a translation from italian shall we have another look at the writing you sent me?",3,3
35944,127,"student: i should use 'some kind of' when i don't know an exact description, right? like there is some kind of regulation you must follow... yes!  teacher: not necessarily, you can use 'some' with a singular countable noun. just thinking of an example some mr johnson called this morning' to say 'i have no idea which mr johnson' or you can use 'a' there a mr johnson caleed this morning' *called again, to express that you don't know who he is",3,2
35945,127,"student: okay, got it thank you!  teacher: or, 'it was the mr johnson' (the one we've been talking about / thinking about) anyway, elon musk! i would have said 'the elon musk' if he had a more common name, but it's not like there are many people with this name around the = that one, the one who created tesla a beautiful inside view in the life of a man who seems capable of almost everything, that is running multiple complex enterprises which are shaping the world.",3,3
35946,127,"student: that -&gt; who right? the one after the comma  teacher: ah, did you mean 'that' as 'who'?? yes, who would be much better in this case because otherwise there is an ambiguity that is' reads as an explanation of the phrase before it like 'i.e.' does this make sense?",3,2
35947,127,"student: as always italian is the problem: in this context the italian word for 'that' and 'who' is the same...  teacher: this child won't eat any solids, i.e. she only eats liquidized food",1,1
35948,127,student: i see it makes sense...if i wanted to write 'i.e.' then what would have been the problem?  teacher: #error! hence the confusion in your sentence,1,2
35949,127,student: i see  teacher: i believe it's a direct translation from latin. i.e. that is. is that correct?,3,3
35950,127,"student: yes, indeed.  teacher: if you wanted to use 'i.e.' in your original sentence, i would argue that there would be a logical problem a beautiful inside view in the life of a man who seems capable of almost everything, i.e. running multiple complex enterprises which are shaping the world. running multiple enterprises is not the same as 'almost everything'",4,4
35951,127,"student: as 'e.g.' means 'exepli gratia', which roughly translates to 'for example'(but not precisely)  teacher: yes, true!",3,2
35952,127,"student: i see...yes, i see your point after i.e. an explanation should follow, in my case i just continued the description...  teacher: yes, you've got it! a man who ... and who.... would work better ok, moving on i believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, to focus more on 'how can it be solved?' rather than finding a scapegoat or complaining about it.",3,3
35953,127,"student: i see, thank you...the difference between 'that' and 'who' is so basic...learning that i sometimes use them uncorrectly is a surprise, but that is why i am here.  teacher: this sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but it also doesn't read very well. for starters, could you change the direct question into an indirect one?",3,2
35954,127,student: ...(which is) to focus more on how to solve a problem  teacher: you can use 'that' for 'who'. the problem was that it was creating an ambiguity in your sentence,3,1
35955,127,"student: i think i would also need to add 'which is' after the comma okay, 'that + is' might be unclear, i'll remember this  teacher: yes, i totally read it as 'i.e.' rather than 'who' when a problem comes, which is to focus... is this what you mean?",3,2
35956,127,"student: i am trying to refer to the attitude...  teacher: it's a good suggestion, i like it",3,1
35957,127,"student: haha, thank you what about the indirect question...was 'how to solve a problem' what you were thinking of?  teacher: ..., which is to focus more on how ___ ___ __solved yes! oh, how to solve a problem works too",2,2
35958,127,"student: ...mmm...the alternative you were suggesting is 'how to get a problem solved'?  teacher: how it can be solved how can it be solved?' changes into 'how it can be solved', right?",3,1
35959,127,"student: okay, i see..my exaple had one extra word. yes, you are right! i don't know why i couldn't see it...i guess because i was thinking at the whole sentence i wrote  teacher: it would just read more smoothly. also, if you read you text out loud to someone who couldn't see the '' '', there would be a grammatical mistake no worries, like you say, that's why we are here and one last thing with this sentence! his attitude, which is to focus on ... rather than find a scapegoat and complain not finding and complaining because you need a parallel structure there to focus (infinitive), find (infinitive) and complain (infinitive)",3,3
35960,127,"student: oh, i see! if you write only the very, the structure is clear...  teacher: you don't need to repeat the 'to' in front of every verb though, because the one 'to' works for all them",4,2
35961,127,"student: i see...the structure is parallel because i used 'rather', right?  teacher: yes, the attitude is to focus rather than find and complain not: the attitude is to focus rather than finding and complaining",3,3
35962,127,"student: okay! if i used 'to find' and 'to complain' it would still be grammatically correct, right? though more difficult to read...  teacher: yes, it would! could you rewrite the whole sentence, actually, taking into account the three corrections? this is the original again i believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, to focus more on 'how can it be solved?' rather than finding a scapegoat or complaining about it.",3,4
35963,127,"student: i believe there are many lessons to learn such as his attitude when a problem comes, which is to focus more on how it can be solved rather than find a scapegoat and complain about it. hopefully i found all the mistakes.  teacher: yes! lovely :) this sounds much more streamlined one quick thing from the next sentence before i let you go, just to get it out of the way",3,3
35964,127,student: okay  teacher: musk detailed about the history on how the first secretary of spacex finished... i would suggest 'musk gave a detailed account of the history' detail as a verb is used more often with documents e.g. a report detailing the history... a statement detailing what happened,3,2
35965,127,"student: okay, so it is not people detaling the history, but rather documents...i see  teacher: in any case, detail (object) rather than detail (about) yes, but people can give detailed accounts of / talk in detail about go into detail of is another good one he went into detail of what happened... sorry, not of! on / about go into detail about what happened",3,3
35966,127,"student: i see..okay, thank you! my teacher went into detail about my mistakes. the teacher report detailed my mistakes.  teacher: haha, good example!",4,2
35967,127,"student: thank you!  teacher: i hope you don't feel discouraged. you are still absolutely fluent in english, just the minor things here and there that might be worth tidying up",4,3
35968,127,"student: i don't feel discouraged at all! i am just realizing how much italian influcences how i speak...and how difficult it will be to improve grammar correction system i am working on: these sort of subtle differences are very difficult to grasp for a pc because you have to understand what you are reading; no computer can even come close to that...at least for now. so i am finding this very interesting :)  teacher: my knowledge of what ai can and can't do is very superficial, i'm afraid! anyway, i definitely have to let you go! same time next week?",4,4
35969,127,"student: okay! perfect ank your for all the help! have a nice week!  teacher: great, have a good week, speak to you then! you're very welcome :)",3,1
35970,127,student: bye!!  teacher: bye!,2,0
35972,152,"student: hi, <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?",3,2
35973,152,"student: fine, thank you how are you?  teacher: i'm fine too, thank you have you managed to grab a black friday bargain?",3,3
35974,152,student: ok ) i've just told to <student's friend> and <student's friend1> that i'm very disappointed )  teacher: oh no! why is that?,3,2
35975,152,student: no sales for the stuff what i would like to buy i would like to buy a pair of leggings for my yoga  teacher: sorry to hear that! very disappointing indeed! what did you want?,3,2
35976,152,student: and some presents for new ear year for my niece a home robe  teacher: that's a shame!,1,1
35977,152,"student: or a gown? and some lol thongs for <student's child>  teacher: a robe or a dressing gown, i don't think there's much of a difference!",3,2
35978,152,student: it's so expensive!  teacher: i think it's usually a robe in a hotel or sauna the lol stuff?,1,1
35979,152,student: the lol stuff ) yes she wants one from saint nicolas and another one from sanya ) santa  teacher: i've got to start buying christmas presents. some of my friends are really organized and have everything already but i haven't got a single one!,3,3
35980,152,"student: me too  teacher: oh, there's now a saint nicholas day in ukraine, right?",2,2
35981,152,"student: i have now only advent calendar ) and it's funny because <student's child> has noticed it in the wardrobe )  teacher: oh, you've found an advent calendar? oops))",3,3
35982,152,"student: i've bought that one with lol ) first window with a doll and others with some stuff like clothes and accessories  teacher: oh wow, that's very cool! <teacher's child>'s just going to have a plain chocolate one",3,3
35983,152,"student: we have a saint nicolas day here it becomes more and more popular  teacher: i nearly bought a cheese advent calendar for <teacher's husband> and me, but i'm not going to have enough patience to only eat one piece a day :))",4,4
35984,152,"student: hahaha same story with me  teacher: yes, i remember from working with children 5 years ago it _______ more and more popular",3,2
35985,152,student: i thought about some advent calendar for me or for me and <student's husband> but as a _____ person i've started to think how to use it it has become?  teacher: what kind of person?)),3,3
35986,152,"student: practichniy )  teacher: hmm, i was thinking 'it is becoming', because you're describing a process practical!",3,2
35987,152,student: i thought about beauty advent calender  teacher: that sounds nice!,3,1
35988,152,student: but there are lots of stuff like red lipstick etc which i don't need  teacher: do you know what's popular in the uk? advent calendars for pets!,4,2
35989,152,"student: then i've thinking about a chocolate advent calendar and it seems like we won't be able to eat just one thing per day )  teacher: yes, you know what i mean? children have much better self-control in a way!",3,3
35990,152,student: oh! i've seen that stuff on the uk websites and on the instagram  teacher: we'd just sit down one night with wine and crackers and eat all the cheese from the calendar))),3,4
35991,152,student: children have us for the control )  teacher: that's true))),1,2
35992,152,"student: ok, so now in ukraine we have saint nicolas day, two christmas and two new year ) it's amazing! )))) *nes years new ) sorry  teacher: oh my goodness! is that a bit too many holidays?",3,3
35993,152,"student: yes! ))  teacher: but you can't skip saint nicholas day, especially when <student's child> starts school because all children will get presents)))",4,4
35994,152,"student: yes )  teacher: we don't do new year presents anymore, just christmas. but i cook lots of ukrainian food on new year, and sometimes we watch a soviet movie, subtitled",4,4
35995,152,"student: actually, it's ok, because now she knows about saint nicolas day and new year  teacher: but i'm careful about this now",2,2
35996,152,student: ))  teacher: we watched 'the irony of fate' a couple of years ago,3,1
35997,152,"student: actually yesterday i had a funny picture from <student's husband>  teacher: i'm not sure it's the best translation, do you know what i mean? and i didn't like it!",1,1
35998,152,"student: about irony sudby  teacher: oh, like a meme?",2,2
35999,152,student: the irony of fate' sure! ok it's something like have you noticed that the teacher of russian told 'i need edit'my new dress' sorry i need 'odet' )))  teacher: true!!! i've noticed that before!!,3,3
36000,152,"student: i think me too but it's really funny )  teacher: it is! i really didn't like it last time, it's so sexist!",3,2
36001,152,"student: yes and about the translation i completely agree with you  teacher: like, the protagonist is telling nadya that she is basically a failure because she didn't get married by 34",3,3
36002,152,student: it's so strange  teacher: and she agrees!,1,2
36003,152,"student: yes and i know that lots of people don't like the movie because of zhenya he doesn't look like a hero ) but for me he is ok  teacher: well, he is nice, he is supposed to be an 'intelligent'",4,3
36004,152,"student: he is just 'usual person' )  teacher: but, for example, she asks him to leave several times and he just refuses!",3,2
36005,152,student: an 'usual person'  teacher: this is really weird,1,1
36006,152,"student: yes! agree  teacher: good correction, you need an article there, but it's actually 'a'",3,2
36007,152,student: especially now lots of things in the movie aren't ok  teacher: a usual person ju.u.l because it actually starts with a consonant /j/,2,1
36008,152,student: here in ukraine we haven't watch that movies since 2014 i think because it actually starts with a consonant /j/ - ok! thank you it's clear!  teacher: i ___ ____ it for years until i watched it with <teacher's husband> two years ago (not watch) what tense do you think goes here?,3,2
36009,152,"student: at first we had a ban for soviet movies on tv  teacher: oh, i didn't know that! because i don't watch tv i suppose",2,2
36010,152,"student: i hadn't had it for years until i watched it with <teacher's husband> two years ago (not watch) sorry hadn't watched  teacher: yes, well done! :) nice past perfect",3,1
36011,152,student: we too we don't have a tv at home  teacher: we have a tv but only for streaming services)),2,2
36012,152,"student: but i mean that because of the ban lots of people who watched that stuff just stoped watching it  teacher: as much as i love to chat, let's have a look at your homework! well done you for doing extra homework, by the way! ah, it worked then, the ban",3,1
36013,152,"student: yes! thank you )  teacher: i think it's important, to stop doing the same stuff as people across the border",3,2
36014,152,student: yes sorry one more thing  teacher: go on!,3,1
36015,152,"student: i've just remembered it my student <student's student> has sent me a link to watch a very interesting lecture about ukrainian i can send you that one  teacher: ooh, thank you, i'd love that! could you send it to me on messenger?",4,3
36016,152,"student: sure  teacher: later on) ok! hello <teacher>, thank you for your interest to our school. we provide ukrainian and russian lessons for students with any level of knowledge. the price per individual one hour lesson is 500 uah. usually we offer a trial lessons for a new student. it could be 30 minutes free trial lesson or 1 hour lessons for usual price 500 uah. please, let us know what option is more preferable for you and which language do you prefer to learn. we have to inform you that because of the covid situation we provide only online classes. but they still are as much effective as the lessons at school. as for our teacher and the teaching method. we assure you that our teachers as much experienced as students needs oriented. in our lessons we use the comunicative method which means that our goal is to teach you how to speak with ukrainian or russian speaking people an understand them. despite of it we assure we will help you also with the grammar, reading etc. if you have any other questions please do not hesitate to contact us. best regards, <student> from <student's company> team",4,1
36017,152,"student: ok! sorry! let's start )  teacher: no worries ah, it's annoying that there is no formatting in this chat",2,0
36018,152,student: yes! )  teacher: very good and the message is clear! let's look at some bits that are wrong,3,1
36019,152,"student: ok!  teacher: when we compare two things with an adjective, we use (not) as ... as lol stuff is as expensive as lego or 'not as expensive as lego'",3,2
36020,152,student: ok  teacher: so you know what to do with ' our teachers as much experienced as students needs oriented' :),2,1
36021,152,"student: hm without much?  teacher: yes, that's right!",2,1
36022,152,student: ok it's funny  teacher: but they still are as much effective as the lessons at school,3,2
36023,152,student: at first i've written like that  teacher: and same here),1,1
36024,152,student: as effective as the lessons at school  teacher: yes!,1,1
36025,152,student: they still are or they are still ?  teacher: they are still,3,2
36026,152,"student: sure! ok and one more question  teacher: yes, of course!",3,1
36027,152,student: as much doesn't have any sense?  teacher: it does! i'm thinking of an example,3,2
36028,152,"student: ok )  teacher: i have as much milk as yogurt milk and yogurt are uncountable nounds, so they work with much he has as much money as i do but! teacher x has as many students as teacher y. because students are countable",3,3
36029,152,student: ok  teacher: *nouns,1,1
36030,152,student: but i can't use it with abstract things like experience or students orienting )  teacher: you can! i have as much love for my niece as for my nephew)) a bit of a silly sentence,3,2
36031,152,student: ok  teacher: i have so much more love for strawberries than for onions)) but you don't need 'much' with an adjective in an 'as...as' comparison,3,3
36032,152,"student: ah! ok  teacher: ah, i think i know where the confusion is coming from! online lessons are much more effective than face-to-face",3,2
36033,152,student: so i need much when i talk about nouns  teacher: you can 'much' to modify 'more' in this structure,2,1
36034,152,student: ahh  teacher: or 'less',1,0
36035,152,student: sure  teacher: much more / much less,1,1
36036,152,student: much more!  teacher: much more expensive yes!,4,2
36037,152,"student: thank you it's clear now  teacher: while we are on this topic, you can also use 'twice / half / three times' etc. with as... as",4,3
36038,152,"student: sure thank you i've forgot this stuff unfortunately but now it's better )  teacher: if lol dolls are 20 pounds but lego is 10 pounds, lol dolls are twice as expensive as lego and lego is half as expensive as lol no worries, i'll send you some exercises to practise at home",3,4
36039,152,"student: maybe i need some homework for practicing that stuff ) oh, thank you )  teacher: houses in cambridge are twice as expensive as in march :)",1,3
36040,152,student: )  teacher: or even 'three times',2,1
36041,152,student: but you have a garden )  teacher: exactly! a garden that is three times as big as in one of those new cambridge houses))),3,3
36042,152,"student: )))  teacher: ok, let's see what else we've got time for! oh, the very first sentence, thanks for your interest in our school",1,1
36043,152,student: you are an expert in making examples ) interest for ?  teacher: interest in! same as 'interested in',3,2
36044,152,student: ah! yes/ sorry )  teacher: i'm interested in insects or something like that (i'm not!),2,1
36045,152,"student: haha me too  teacher: oh, and a quick one on saying how long things take if you're using one-hour as an adjective, you need a hyphen - - - one-hour that little '-' is a hypen",4,2
36046,152,"student: ok!  teacher: also, in an adjective of this kind, all words are singular the lesson is 30 minutes. but! it's a 30-minute lesson we lose the 's' and add a '-' same with distances. a 5-mile walk",3,1
36047,152,"student: ok! i see!  teacher: ah, i'm afraid that's all we have time for today! we'll look into this more next time, and i do remember about your questions!",3,2
36048,152,student: thank you!!  teacher: my pleasure :),4,1
36049,152,"student: have a good weekand bye!  teacher: thank you! you too, have a relaxing weekend! bye!",3,2
36051,12,"teacher: hi <student>, happy new year! how are you?  student: happy new year! good, thank you.",3,1
36052,12,"teacher: great - how was your christmas - did you stay in cambridge?  student: no, we went to mallorca island... it was very warm and sunny! how was your trip to the lake district?",4,3
36053,12,teacher: oh right yes - i remember now you said you were going away! what did you think of mallorca?  student: there were beautiful beaches and i felt really relaxed as few people were there.,3,4
36054,12,teacher: right that sounds lovely i spent a few years living in spain and i do miss it sometimes!  student: oh really! was it for your work?,4,3
36055,12,teacher: well yes basically - i just taught in different schools  student: then you must miss sunshine during winter.,3,4
36056,12,teacher: yeah i do miss the sun! <student>: 'few people' = formal or normal?  student: i thought it's normal... but formal?,2,3
36057,12,teacher: a bit yes....can you tell me the thing you said about mallorca in a different way? the thing about few people i mean  student: not many people were there... but it sounds different.,3,4
36058,12,"teacher: in meaning you mean? it's ok - it has the same meaning (but sounds different yes because it's less formal!) look, this is what i had already written to reply to your earlier question!: yes the lake district was lovely not warm and sunny! but the weather wasnt too bad. there arent quite so many people in winter either so its a bit more peaceful you know? #  student: hmm... i thought few people mean that we rarely see people.",3,3
36059,12,"teacher: by the way, 'there weren't many people' is a more common order than 'not many people were there' um...'few' by itself doesn't give information about frequency how can you say the opposite? i.e. in winter there aren't many people but in summer...  student: i see. it sounds like 'few' is fewer than 'not many', but it's the same, right? in summer there are many people.",3,2
36060,12,teacher: ah yes of course i see what you mean - yes it is a bit confusing i guess but yes you're absolutely right many people' = formal or normal  student: normal,3,1
36061,12,"teacher: well....a bit formal to be honest! can you think of another way of saying it?  student: oh, really! in summer, there were a lot of people. were are",3,2
36062,12,"teacher: yeah that's it! just to be clear: few and many are perfectly correct and fine but...you will hear people use (not) many and lots much more often i mean in normal speaking  student: i see. so these words sound more natural, right? i mean in daily conversation.",4,3
36063,12,teacher: yes exactly - in most normal situations (for most people!) next time you speak to someone (a native speaker) you'll notice if you think about it!  student: thank you for telling me. that's very helpful for me.,3,2
36064,12,"teacher: no problem - quick practice <student>: tell me about somewhere you've been in the uk with large and small numbers of people  student: large number: london, oxford, cambridge",2,1
36065,12,teacher: ok i mean with the words we've just focused on!  student: sorry ^^;,3,0
36066,12,teacher: that' ok ha ha  student: there are lots of people in london while there are not many people in corby.,2,2
36067,12,teacher: ok fine and good for the negative form (you contrct in speech right (aren't)? - 'lots' is fine - a different word? contract  student: a lot of but didn't you say 'lots' is used more often?,3,3
36068,12,teacher: also correct (no difference) ...what about 'loads'? do you use this word?  student: i've never heard 'loads'...,3,2
36069,12,"teacher: really? ok, it's really common seriously - i bet you'll notice it now i've mentioned it!  student: oh,thank you.",3,1
36070,12,teacher: it's common in normal informal speech - also can be quite emphatic as in lots and lots!  student: so is it used like 'there are loads of people in london' ?,3,3
36071,12,teacher: yeah absolutely... or e.g. i went to the swimming pool - there were loads of peopel because it's the school holidays...ok <student> one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal? people of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too  student: i think it's normal.,3,2
36072,12,teacher: ok...it's certainly perfectly possible and correct...can you think of a different word?!  student: seldom?,2,3
36073,12,"teacher: good idea! so in order of formality: seldom, rarely and hardly ever you've heard that before?  student: so you mean hardly is the most casual? i know these words, but i've never thought about the order of formality.",4,4
36074,12,"teacher: yes ' hardly ever' (two words together) is by far the most common in normal speaking. just to clarify: 'seldom' = correct but very formal i.e. many english people will never have said it in their lives!  student: hardly + ever', i see... he hardly ever comes to school on time. like that?",4,3
36075,12,"teacher: yep perfect example - and by far the most common form you would hear in everyday life - quick pronunciation question <student>: can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' as in opposite of uncle and 'aren't' (are not)  student: yes, i can... aren't has 'r' sound.",3,2
36076,12,teacher: for most british people?  student: what do you mean? do they sound the same in theuk?,3,3
36077,12,"teacher: yes exactly they sound exactly the same for me so e.g. both are: /nt/ sorry, do you understand the phonemic symbols?  student: oh, really!? is that like a dialect? i can understand the phonemic symbols.",3,4
36078,12,"teacher: but of course you can say them how you like <student>! (as in with an /r/ if you like - i'm just pointing it out for understanding! and americans and many other english speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! i like the idea of you telling english peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most english people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral english accent - do you see? that's great you can read the symbols by the way - very useful now i can write more stuff!  student: i see, in japan there are a lot of dialect, but in the uk, there are many kinds of accent...",3,3
36079,12,teacher: right i see. you know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary right? so in the uk there aren't really many different dialects left but yes 0 as you say - lots of different accents have you noticed/heard any difference in accents in the uk  student: interesting. hmm... my friend said 'scone' has two accents. 'sco:n' and 'scoun'/// i'm not sure if the symbols are correct,3,4
36080,12,"teacher: ah i see - a classic example! yes good one! i guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? as in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word! and peopel who choose the same verision of that word might still have a different accent if you see what i mean?! version  student: sorry, i cannot understand. what is the difference?",3,2
36081,12,"teacher: so if i say /skn/ (and i do!) an e.g. scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are scottish and a person from the south of egnland like me might say /skn/ (not like me) but i would still hear that they have the same accent as me in general sorry <student> - have i confused you more?!  student: oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as i don't know the background!",3,3
36082,12,"teacher: ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. americans normally have an /r/ and most english people don't but the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing one more <student> - a really big accent thing: in the south of england we say /a:/ as in /b/ and in the north they say //  student: i see. i got it. ah, how about the word 'staff'? in american english it sounds like /staef/ but in the uk it sounds like /sta:f/",3,4
36083,12,teacher: ha! yes great ecample!!!!!!!! example the same as in america in the north of the uk but less nasal!  student: that's interesting. thank you for telling me a lot of things today.,3,2
36084,12,"teacher: ok thanks a lot <student> (you see 'many thanks' much more formal!) i'll contact you soon about a further lesson ok?  student: yes, of course it's ok!",3,2
36085,12,teacher: a lot of things' = good! ok great bye  student: bye!,2,1
36087,190,"student: hi! sorry i need a couple more minute  teacher: hi <student>, no problem",3,1
36088,190,"student: here i am :) how are you?  teacher: hi! all good, and you?",2,2
36089,190,"student: all good...it is even a beautiful day here :)  teacher: it's actually starting to feel like spring here! daffodils are starting to pop through, and i've got snowdrops in my garden :)",3,3
36090,190,"student: oh, that's nice! i am also looking forward to seeing spring...so far it has really been a cold winter!  teacher: yes, it has been a colder winter! which is good, but we've all really had enough by now",3,2
36091,190,"student: indeed! how is it going with the lockdown? here it looks like next week they will remove some restriction... *restrictions  teacher: oh really? i'm so happy for you! well, we're in lockdown until at least march 8, and then there is going to be a phased exit with areas dropping restrictions but others still being quite strict they're now trying to trace and contain this south african variant which is also more contagious we are well stir crazy by now, fantasizing about travelling all the time and watching escapist tv",3,3
36092,190,student: haha... my current dream is to experience silence for a day...without hearing screams or cries from my children... but i will have to wait a bit longer for that...  teacher: i'm feeling for you. toddlerhood is tough! didn't you say the childminder was still allowed to work?,3,2
36093,190,"student: yes...luckily she has always been allowed to work, so i had a few free mornings... but for a number of reasons she never worked 5 days a week...anyhow, if i didn't go crazy it is probably also thanks to her help  teacher: good that you have some support! i can only say that it gets easier with time. just as sweet, but a bit easier :)",3,2
36094,190,"student: i really hope so :) well, to be onest the oldest child, almost 3, is starting to behave a bit..now it is his brother who is a bit problematic...  teacher: yes, they call this age 'the terrible twos' here, even though he isn't even 2 yet!",3,3
36095,190,"student: i have hear that expression, yes...we don't have it in italian, but it should definitely be imported!  teacher: haha, yes, but the danger is, once you say this, you start to see them in this way and three-year-olds are sometimes called 'threenagers' because they can be moody like teenagers",4,4
36096,190,"student: haha...i had never heard of that expression! threenagers, it sounds funny :)  teacher: it does :)) ok, shall we have a look at the rest of the idioms from comments?",3,3
36097,190,"student: yes! i was just going to say that the last week was extremely busy so i still haven't read the article...but i will!  teacher: there are a couple more that i wanted to share with you you don't have to! i just thought it might give you some context, but it's by no means obligatory oh, i think we didn't mention the meaning of 'play up' that is to do with children",3,2
36098,190,"student: don't worry...it is for me: the more i work on this, the more i learn no, we didn't...  teacher: we talked about play up / play down, didn't we?",3,3
36099,190,"student: yes, even though i can't remember exactly the meaning and i am pretty sure children weren't involved  teacher: yes, you can talk about the crazy english notion of 'class' :) yes, we talked in terms of 'exaggerate / minimize the importantce of' *sorry, i meant 'you can learn'",2,4
36100,190,"student: oh yes, now i recall!  teacher: yes, but 'play up' (or 'act up') has another meaning: start to misbehave for example, little peter is playing up a bit, he must be tired the boys have been playing up at school again",3,3
36101,190,student: my son <student's son> always plays up after finishing a meal.  teacher: after finishing a meal? because he's full and happy? :),3,4
36102,190,"student: no, because he's full and realizes that left over food has a big potential, if you want to soil the whole room.  teacher: haha :)) sorry, i shouldn't laugh!",3,3
36103,190,"student: haha, it is funny, until you have to clean up the mess!  teacher: a big potential as an art material definitely ok, we talked about 'giving someone a leg up', didn't we?",3,4
36104,190,"student: indeed...well, maybe the story about cattelan's banana reached even the uk? the artist who used a banana for one of his art pieces... yes, my childminder is giving me a leg up...would it be okay if used like this?  teacher: no, is it a recent story? i haven't heard! hmm, no, unless she paid for your phd! :))",3,3
36105,190,"student: no, that's not the case ;) it's from 2019, so ages ago https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773 okay...but i am giving a leg up to my children...  teacher: the childminder probably gives your boys a leg up if they want to climb somewhere but can't yes! you are giving your children a leg up ah, now i remember, the image rings a bell! of a banana i mean",3,3
36106,190,"student: yes, it is one of those dumb stories that gets a lot of news coverage for a few days...so it would probably ring a beel to almost anyone  teacher: oh, this is an interesting comment, on the fluidity / rigidity of the class system the mistake is assuming that the middle class is closer to the upper class than to the working class. losing one's job can make you go from middle class to working class in a heartbeat, but most will never even be close to the upper class even if they spend a lifetime doing very well. i think there are two nice expressions here, but which one would you pick? ones",3,2
36107,190,"student: in a hartbeat'...meaning in a very short time  teacher: yes, exactly! a very good one",3,3
36108,190,"student: to be honest i don't see a second one  teacher: oh, i meant 'to spend a lifetime (doing something)' thinking about it, do well is also a good one also, do well out of... she is a songwriter and is doing surprisingly well out of it which means have financial success",3,2
36109,190,"student: because of covid, many people aren't doing that well right now...  teacher: exactly! covid cost so many people their livelihoods ok, one last i admit it's not rocket science sociology. but the government probably need a commission to help them to understand this. so i hope the writer is doing his bit there. have you heard the expression 'it's not rocket science'?",3,3
36110,190,"student: yes, to be honest i think it is used more often in the us, could that be the case? anyway, it means 'it is nothing that complex'  teacher: hmm, i would say it's used in the uk as well! yes, of course! what's a synonymous expression? 'it's not ___ ___' that is another field of knowledge",3,3
36111,190,"student: oh... i really don't know...i know many people think math is hard, so i would guess 'it's not like math' but it doesn't sound right  teacher: nope, but good guess! the expression is 'it's not brain surgery' i've got to remember to send you a link to a comedy sketch about these two expressions after class",3,4
36112,190,student: i am pretty sure i had never hear that one...okay!  teacher: do you enjoy english comedy?,3,3
36113,190,"student: cool :) yes, i do...to be honest i like it better than italian comedy, which i find too dumb (as in i want to go outside of the room because it is too ashaming even to watch).  teacher: oh no! i'm trying to think what i know of italian comedy. english can be pretty silly but can be quite sophisticated",3,4
36114,190,"student: there are some movies which are produced for christmas in italy, called 'cinepanettone' (panettone-movie) which represent this italian awful comedy...  teacher: there is an english comedy website that does always cheer me up, it's called the daily mash. it kind of mimics a newspaper, but the news is satire",3,3
36115,190,"student: another example is checco zalone, his comedy is actually a bit better...  teacher: it especially likes to make fun of middle class people ah, i'm with you, there are awful awful awful comedy shows on tv in the uk, they make me blush too! and they also seem to culminate around christmas",3,2
36116,190,"student: i'll give it a look! we also have such satirical papers in italian, i guess the most well known is 'lercio' meaning 'filthy'...but to be honest some of their pages are good, and the name is more of a pun with 'leggo' (i read) which is a newspaper.  teacher: ok, interesting! i must warn that it can be quite sweary. but funny! i'm thinking back to the expression you used, for something that provokes shame. we can say 'i'm ashamed of', but it doesn't really work with an -ing",3,3
36117,190,"student: haha, i see...well, to be honest, i believe the italian culture is less concerned with swearing than the anglo-saxon one...i mean, it is a 'bad' thing...but it took me years to understand why on american tv shows they were censoring certain words...  teacher: embarrassing' would probably be a good one here",2,2
36118,190,"student: okay...yes, i wasn't really sure how to express that...i find italian comedy often embarrassing  teacher: hmm, actually, i wonder if americans are more concerned with swearing than brits brits love to swear, including on tv yes, and a good collocation is 'excrutiatingly embarrassing'",2,3
36119,190,"student: really? i had never noticed...but then, i don't watch much tv from the uk...  teacher: you know, excrutiating = horribly painful",3,2
36120,190,student: nice :)  teacher: excrutiating pain; excrutiatingly embarrassing,2,1
36121,190,"student: yes, i know that expression :)  teacher: i can imagine americans would be more prude about swearing looking at it, i bet it's from latin too excrutiating anyway, would the same time next week suit you?",3,2
36122,190,student: yes!  teacher: lovely!,2,0
36123,190,"student: (i just checked: you are right, but the closest italian word is a bit different, as it has lost the initial 'ex' sound and changed others) perfect, then i guess see you next week :) thank you for the lesson and have a nice day!  teacher: interesting! knowing romance languages has definitely given you a leg up in terms of english :) yes, talk to you next week! my pleasure, bye!",3,3
36125,119,student: hi again  teacher: hi <student>! :) all ok with you?,2,2
36126,119,"student: yeah  teacher: it's nearly holiday time, isn't it?",3,3
36127,119,"student: yes tomorrow is a day of and holidays will start on the 22 of october  teacher: oh yes, i know. it's a combined church holiday and the day of the army, right?",3,4
36128,119,student: *off yes day of kozaki  teacher: the day of cossacks? really? i thought it was to do with the modern army!,3,3
36129,119,"student: and the day of defender of ukraine yes and we must to congratulate our boys today  teacher: oh no, but they are not the cossacks :)",3,4
36130,119,"student: future defenders of ukraine  teacher: i see! a quick memory test: some of the words from the past lessons penultimate (adjective), to expel, to stand up for something / to someone, at ease, up my street, get into something now, which one means 'to tell a student they can't be in this school anymore'?",3,3
36131,119,"student: when we wanted to say something nice to them, i was trying to make everybody calm, but one boy threw his pencilcase to me i don't remember (  teacher: whaat? that's awful! are you in charge of events like this because you are the head girl?",3,4
36132,119,"student: i was upset with that, but he said sorry and he saod that he wanted to throw it to his friend yes but to be honest it made me cry  teacher: oh, that makes it a little better that he said sorry, doesn' tit?",2,3
36133,119,"student: yes, it is  teacher: oh no, i can imagine!",2,2
36134,119,"student: because i am doing everything for our class for them and they don't appreciate it  teacher: yes, i see, you are in a very difficult position in this role! have you talked to your class teacher about it?",3,3
36135,119,"student: she saw me crying  teacher: you can't be expected to discipline everyone and look after them, you are not a grown-up!",1,2
36136,119,"student: and my friend <student's friend> accidentally hit my leg on the pe lesson maybe so today is bad day *a  teacher: oh, school is tough!",3,1
36137,119,student: yeah  teacher: is your mum home when you get back?,3,1
36138,119,"student: no  teacher: oh, i see, so you can't talk to her until later?",3,2
36139,119,"student: yes she is in the salon now i've told my dad about is *t  teacher: oh good ok, <student>, i'm going to give you the words and their meanings, and you try and match them, ok? penultimate (adjective), to expel, to stand up for something / to someone, at ease, up my street, get into something",3,3
36140,119,"student: okay  teacher: 1. to make a student leave school (because of bad behaviour, for example)",1,1
36141,119,"student: to expel  teacher: yes, correct! for example, this boy was _____ from school for bad behaviour",3,2
36142,119,"student: expelled  teacher: yes, well done! does your school ever expel students?",3,3
36143,119,student: maybe my school wanted to expel one boy from another class  teacher: it was from our hp words. hp nearly got expelled from hogwarts several times :) and what happened?,3,4
36144,119,"student: he is still in our school  teacher: ah, ok :) he is still __ our school",2,2
36145,119,student: but now they want to expel one of my classmates  teacher: do you think they should expel your classmate? or do you think they should fight for them / support them to do better?,3,3
36146,119,"student: he is those friend who my classmate threw a pencilcase to  teacher: i see, so he must get into trouble a lot!",4,2
36147,119,"student: well, his behavior is really bad, but he is a bit nice as a person he invited me to his birthday last week  teacher: that's sweet! ok, next word! the last but one =",3,2
36148,119,"student: penultimate  teacher: well done! for example, y is the penultimate letter of the alphabet next one: to defend an idea / a person who is being attacked / criticized",3,1

36166,119,"student: oh yeah it is nice! what is wrong with the animations for the adults?  teacher: two more ways to say something is exactly what you like: my cup of tea, my jam don't know, i just prefer actors! nothing's wrong, they can be really talented they are just not my cup of tea :)))",3,3
36167,119,student: yeah  teacher: have you heard this one? 'my cup of tea' / 'not my cup of tea'?,3,2

36179,80,student: that's nice  teacher: but i haven't been in any of them :),2,1
36180,80,student: why? you don't really need it?  teacher: it's not fun anymore! you have to queue outside while social distancing i buy things online,3,3
36181,80,"student: oh, i understand i don't like online shopping  teacher: oh really? why not?",4,4
36182,80,"student: when you buy some food online, delivery can get you not the best and newest food  teacher: oh i see, yes, i know in kyiv supermarkets don't really do deliveries",2,3
36183,80,"student: when you buy clothes, it can suit you or not, maybe the size isn't correct and then you wait again for long no, they do! not all of them  teacher: food can be out of date / past it's best, or it can be - (the opposite)? sorry, 'past its best'",3,2
36184,80,"student: worst  teacher: if the food is really nice, just picked or cooked, it's ...",0,3

36189,80,"student: yes,leftover food  teacher: yes, correct! or leftovers another word from before: what's the sound that a mouse makes?",2,3
36190,80,"student: squeak  teacher: yes, correct! there's an expression in english, 'a squeaky wheel gets the grease' what do you think it means?",3,4
36191,80,student: what does it mean grease?  teacher: it's the oil that we can use on a wheel to stop the squeak,3,2
36192,80,"student: oh , okay so i think it means that everyone who needs help will always get it?  teacher: ah, good idea! close! it means that people who talk about their problems will get the help and people who are quiet will not",3,3
36193,80,student: okay  teacher: it's a bit negative,2,1
36194,80,"student: ?  teacher: e.g. my colleague got a new desk because he always complains about his back. now, my back's hurting too but i never complain. i guess a squeaky wheel gets the grease! (imaginary situation) ok?",3,3
36195,80,"student: yeah, i understand  teacher: ok, next word! there is a virus out there, and people have to stay at home and lots of places are closed. what's this situation called?",3,2
36196,80,"student: quarantine  teacher: yes, correct spelling, thank you! when everything was stopped in the uk, it was called a lockdown only essential shopping, no going out etc. great, and one last word from the previous class. control over our actions that we use to keep doing something hard",3,3

36198,80,student: of course it is  teacher: do you think you have a lot of it?,2,3
36199,80,student: i think 60/40  teacher: how do you know?,2,3

36201,80,"student: <student> told me there aren't any places anymore  teacher: yes, i told him we stopped recruiting while we were waiting for the form to be approved, but then i wrote back to him and invited him are you thinking about willpower? or waiting for me to say something? it's a bit hard to tell because i can't see whether you're typing",3,3
36202,80,"student: i was waiting while you ate saying something about it so willpower  teacher: ah, no worries go on",3,1
36203,80,student: i am sometimes to lazy to do something  teacher: some psychologists today believe it's not a thing! willpower is a made-up construct.,3,3
36204,80,"student: ?  teacher: for example, the reason i don't have a packet of crisps for lunch is not my amazing willpower but my concern over my health",4,2
36205,80,student: oh  teacher: the reason a person might study hard is because they want to learn something / want to achieve the social status that studying hard can give them etc.,2,1
36206,80,student: that's my reasons  teacher: and the reason many diets don't work is becausea no one has enought willpower. because it's not a thing! what do you think?,3,3
36207,80,"student: i don't know what to say ...  teacher: ok, no worries. just something to think about shall we go back to your quiz? the white dog!",2,2

36230,80,student: okay  teacher: i know there's no difference in ukrainian / russian,2,1
36231,80,"student: yea  teacher: ok, top! is it an abbreviation?",3,2

36237,80,student: but there are only two people in their band  teacher: and none of them are pilots?,3,3
36238,80,"student: so somebody asked them 'where are another nineteen pilots?' none of them  teacher: :))) i see can you give me one minute, i thought of an interesting homework for you, just need to find a link",3,2
36239,80,"student: okay  teacher: you know what, i'll send the link to you on skype. i'd like you to watch a short video of the so-called 'marshmallow test'. do you know what it is?",3,3
36240,80,student: no  teacher: do you know 'marshmallow'?,3,1
36241,80,student: dj?  teacher: probably :),1,2
36242,80,"student: yes  teacher: but originally it's a yummy dessert, similar to ukrainian 'zefir'",3,3
36243,80,student: i know it is tasty  teacher: you will see the rest in the video! it's to do with the idea of willpower!,3,2
36244,80,"student: but they are not similar!  teacher: ok, now, would thursday 10 am suit you? no, zefir is better!",1,1
36245,80,"student: i think yes marshmallows are better:)  teacher: great, i'll send you the link then, have a lovely day! nooo, zefir is better :)",3,2
36246,80,"student: thank you , bye!!!  teacher: bye <student> :)",4,1
36248,257,teacher: hi <student>!  student: hi,2,1
36249,257,"teacher: how are you? we haven't spoken for ages, and now you're on holiday!  student: i fine im * holiday is p oh my god",3,2
36250,257,"teacher: :)) it's ok, take your time  student: my tablet is crazy today wait a second",3,1
36251,257,teacher: sure  student: okay i am ready so my holiday is a bit strange sometimes it is lazy and not interesting but sometimes it is exciting! for example i wake up at 11-12 and i do nothing for hours then i go out with somebody thats not easy to make new ideas what to do for example yesterday i didnt know what to do,2,3
36252,257,"teacher: are you back in kyiv then?  student: than my friend calls me and says that she wrote her zno and the school where she wrote it isnt far from my house yes, im back in kyiv",3,2
36253,257,teacher: i see! sounds like you've got plenty of time on your hands - nice! are you going to do any summer classes or maybe go to a summer camp? or maybe visit your family again?  student: than i call my another friend and we also went out i thought it would be another boring day i go to exam booster from ih,3,3
36254,257,teacher: oh interesting! which exam are you preparing for?  student: we cant visit our family because israel doesnt let anybody there from ukraine im not preparing for something just for the future now i know some more tricks for listening,3,2
36255,257,"teacher: oh shame! you haven't seen your family in israel for a long time now, have you?  student: we are studying from ielts book",3,1
36256,257,"teacher: ah, interesting!  student: yes i havent",2,2
36257,257,"teacher: ielts, ok, i see!  student: from 2019",2,1
36258,257,"teacher: the ielts certificate is only valid for 2 years as you probably know, so yes, it only makes sense to take ielts when you need it!  student: so now i know that listening in ielts and the whole ielts test is evil",3,2
36259,257,"teacher: haha, well, there is a reason for it  student: in the end of our course(25 of june) we will have a trial test",2,1
36260,257,"teacher: ielts is a multilevel test. people who are only beginners and people who are fluent take the same test however, there are lots of level tests that cambridge has developed. the one that will be good for you to prepare for if you're interested is b2  student: yeah, i think our book is intermediate or intermediate plus",3,2
36261,257,"teacher: yes, i think the b2 test should be the right level of challenge for you sorry, it's b2 first (it used to be called fce) here's a link if you're curious unlike ielts, a b2 first certificate is forever (it doesn't expire)  student: the link doesnt work",3,1
36262,257,"teacher: ah, it doesn't work in this chatroom, sorry! you can just search for 'cambridge b2 first' using your search engine  student: yeah i checked the site are you here?",2,2
36263,257,"teacher: sure. how did it go with the final test, by the way?  student: oh its okay!",3,3
36264,257,teacher: was it ok?  student: 0.835 or 117/140,1,2
36265,257,"teacher: ooh, that's really good, well done!  student: thanks",4,1
36266,257,"teacher: so... as i mentioned, this is our final class! is there anything you would like to talk about? exams? tips on how to work on your english in the future? books? anything else? maybe you've got a burning grammar question you've been dying to ask me this whole time?  student: oh, maybe we can talk about tips on how to work my english in the future)",4,2
36267,257,teacher: absolutely!  student: now i just understand now that i will miss so much :( *how oh my god,2,2
36268,257,"teacher: aww, i will miss you too! it will be weird, we've been talking for a year now! you always have my skype if you'd like to message me, right?  student: of course do you have any plans for summer?",4,3
36269,257,"teacher: soo... i understand that your goal is to learn 'all english' and be able to communicate fluently. that's the general goal. but right now, what would you like to be able to do in english? talk to people? watch movies? listen to songs and understand lyrics? chat to other roblox players from other countries? i do, yes! we're working (and my son is at school) until the end of july, and then we're going on holiday (yaaaay!) to cornwall. it's a beautiful (and warm!) place in england, in the south-west in the meantime, i'm enjoying the beautiful english summer and especially my garden :)  student: well, for me it is important to understand what i listen to or what i read, even if i dont know the word, i can understand it from the other text, by the way, i want to know more about the difference between different english countries is cornwall a city? wow, you will have only one month of holiday! why?",3,4
36270,257,"teacher: cornwall is a county. do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the uk being divided into counties? it's like 'oblast'  student: oh yeah",3,1
36271,257,"teacher: schoolchildren in this country only get 6 weeks of summer holidays, yes! if you imagine the map of the uk, cornwall is in the bottom left corner :)  student: thats sad oh , makes sense",3,2
36272,257,"teacher: yes, it's unusual for us, isn isn't it but at least it gives parents a chance to work. not many people would be able to take 3 months off to spend with the kids! back to the uk. it's made up of 4 countries. england, scotland, wales and northern ireland. they are all very different and have their local governments. but of course, there's a general uk government and parliament in london but you probably know that, right?  student: yes! at least i know it from the texts from english books, not from geography lesson!",3,3
36273,257,"teacher: yes, sure, it should be in your english texts! ok, to go back to understanding what you hear and what you read in english! the key to understanding is words. i really believe there's no way round it, to learn a language you need to learn lots of new words (and i also think this is the fun part, too!) i really recommend a good dictionary. lots of people use online translations, but a good english-english dictionary that explains instead of translating can do so much more! i always recommend cambridge english dictionary online. you can listen to the pronunciation there too and there are pictures and quizzes!  student: yes , i know that translation words is not as good as understanding them, for example when you speak you remember the translation, not the word",3,2
36274,257,"teacher: exactly! and then just use your favourite way to memorize words, maybe an app or a notebook or post-it notes how do you prefer to learn new words?  student: i tried using an app for studying words but it was boring",3,1
36275,257,"teacher: ok, sure. just a notebook always worked for me, especially a small one that i could carry with me everywhere  student: if i need to study them i just repeat them a lot of times and if i dont know the meaning i google it also i have a vocabulary notebook, i write words there from the fifth form",3,3
36276,257,"teacher: sounds perfect!  student: but it is for school, so there are not meanings, just translation",3,2
36277,257,"teacher: in terms of listening, the trick to understanding is actually pronunciation! once you start to understand how english pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it! sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right?  student: yes",3,1
36278,257,"teacher: we haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :) but! there's a really nice series on the bbc learning english website it's called tim's pronunciation workshop it's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully  student: i will also check it later i found the site",4,2
36279,257,"teacher: you can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know perfect! there's lots of fun stuff to do there, too! and of course, if you'd like a project, i always recommend reading in english (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the hp books are perfect for this the first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. by the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in english and it's easier for you anyway! the way i used to approach reading in english was to learn every single new word at first! it's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! there are usually very few new words by the end of the book  student: i think i will try maybe not the whole book something not long",4,3
36280,257,"teacher: yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes!  student: i think somebody gave me an english book as a gift",3,2
36281,257,"teacher: obviously, if there's a blog / insta / tik tok account that you like in english, that could be perfect for smaller texts  student: probably i like watching tiktok videos on english for example i watch an anime",3,3
36282,257,"teacher: oh yes, i think you mentioned it before!  student: and there is a russian side of it and there is english side",3,2
36283,257,"teacher: oh, like a comic?  student: no, just some videos in tiktok",3,2
36284,257,"teacher: ah sure!  student: you see, if you watch anything (anime, serial , film or else ) you can see some different fandom videos on tiktok",3,3
36285,257,"teacher: ok, <student>, i've got to let you go now! thank you for participating in this project and helping science! it's been a pleasure to talk to you and teach you :)  student: fandom it is fans of something",4,2
36286,257,"teacher: aah, i didn't know that! about fandom videos. i don't know much about tiktok i'm afraid!  student: thank you so much too! that was really fun and interesting to participate! thank you so much for everything youve done to me! i am going to miss you so much! i think we will chat in skype !",4,3
36287,257,"teacher: i'm going to miss you to! take care, have a wonderful summer, write on skype! :))  student: anyway,goodbye! have a good day and summer!",4,2
36289,212,"student: sorry, it's my name as usual ) hi )  teacher: hi <student>! it's ok :) how are you?",3,2
36290,212,"student: fine, but quite (razbitaya) )  teacher: oh, are you feeling exhausted? sorry to hear that!",3,3
36291,212,"student: i don't know if it's the weather changes or i just have to sleep more in the night ) how are you? )  teacher: the beginning of spring is never easy in my experience, we have so little energy left! i'm quite tired too, actually, and fed up with the lockdown. i don't even bake anymore!",3,4
36292,212,"student: i mean i'm ok, but i fell not 100%  teacher: you know 'fed up with'?",3,2
36293,212,"student: i see! it's so hard to be at home all the time and try to work when all the family is there yes! i know 'fed up', like i'm full of it )  teacher: yes, like 'i've had enough of it' yes, indeed! and we can't even go anywhere in our lovely car until march 29",3,4
36294,212,"student: oh, no!  teacher: i noticed i seem to be starting every lesson with complaints about the lockdown... i'll try to be more positive in the future!",3,2
36295,212,student: i'm sorry about it haha  teacher: thank you)),2,1
36296,212,student: i'm ready to be your therapist on the lesson ))  teacher: how's your new marketing campaign? i noticed <student's employee> comment in some russian-learning group with some alma tips,3,3
36297,212,"student: at least you complain in perfect english )))  teacher: aww, thank you, i appreciate it! not always))",3,2
36298,212,"student: ok, we decided just to try posting on facebook and we will see if it works we are not sure 100%  teacher: yes, it's hard to know for sure, but it sounds like a good place to start",2,2
36299,212,"student: and at the same time we will have a 2,5-months marketing course and we will change our strategy i think  teacher: ok, i see! with the lovemark lady? or with 'papa'?",3,3
36300,212,"student: also we are preparing several forms for the existing students and the students who gave up russian or ukrainian we will analyze the data and then change our strategy too the house with the lady )  teacher: ok, sure. do you mean feedback forms?",3,2
36301,212,"student: and now i watch 'papa course@ too' ) papa course' too ) exactly! feedback forms )  teacher: i see! you're properly getting your teeth into it, i'm sure it'll pay off!",3,3
36302,212,"student: ok, 'rasshifruy'))) ah, ok! i see but all this expressions are new to me )  teacher: yes, i thought you'd understand even if you don't know every word )) which is a very useful skill what do you think it means to get your teeth into something?",3,4
36303,212,"student: like i decide to work strong with this stuff )  teacher: yes, exactly! and pay off? like, i'm sure your efforts will pay off!",3,3
36304,212,"student: yes!  teacher: yes, it's quite intuitive :)",3,1
36305,212,"student: i means that if i pay my attention to this topic, i will have good results then  teacher: yes, that's right! e.g. all the running he was doing paid off when he took part in a marathon the marketing campaign started to pay off things like that",3,3
36306,212,"student: i see! thank you  teacher: ok, but you wanted to focus on the 'old' words, didn't you? thanks for your list, you're a very hard-working student!",3,2
36307,212,"student: haha, i'm not sure )  teacher: oh, what's the weather like in kyiv? is it still snowy or has it now turned into .....?",2,3
36308,212,"student: ok it now turned into sl slush sorry  teacher: haha, i like the first spelling)))",3,2
36309,212,student: hahaha )  teacher: that's right! do you know 'slush' the drink? people also say 'slushy' lots of crushed ice and a sweet drink (horrible stuff),3,3
36310,212,"student: no, i don't )  teacher: or, if you're a grown-up, lots of crushed ice, some grapefruit juice (for example) and a shot of vodka that's ok, you're not missing out!",3,4
36311,212,"student: it looks like margarita cocktail  teacher: hmmm, i suppose that crushed ice on top of a margarita is a bit like slush, yes!",3,3

36430,92,"teacher: yes, correct!  student: that was difficult one!",3,2

36432,92,"teacher: not so much in case of 'plants or bugs' because there is an 'or' but generally. do you go to school? yes. are you a student? yes you get the idea when we change these questions into reported speech, we need to use 'if' or 'whether'  student: ok",3,1
36433,92,"teacher: because we don't have a question word, like 'how old' or 'where' or 'when' makes sense?  student: aha",4,1

36529,214,"student: actually i think it's not just about the uk. i think that all the world are watching (on?) this story no, i haven't watched it  teacher: neither have i",2,2
36530,214,student: and actually i'm not sure that i have enough patience to watch  teacher: me neither!,1,1
36531,214,student: yeeees! )) ok! so neither have i )  teacher: that's right :)),3,2
36532,214,"student: m not sure also that i really want to watch it )  teacher: well, they say the uk is split into two. older people are sorry for the queen and 'senior royals' and younger people are sorry for harry and meghan",3,3
36533,214,"student: i'm not sure that i have my own opinion here )  teacher: but i'm not terribly surprised. the royals are not the easiest family to marry into, especially for someone who is used to being an independent woman like meghan was yes, it's hard to say, isn't it! i'm actually much more shocked by something else",3,4
36534,214,"student: i'm sorry for meghan if she feels so bad about the story, but i don't know if she is (truthful)?  teacher: yes, you can say if she is truthful / honest / if she is telling the truth",3,2
36535,214,student: so i don't know what is the right position here )  teacher: remember we were talking about how bills go through parliament and become laws? a while ago?,2,1
36536,214,"student: you've written that you are much more shocked by something else ? what is it?  teacher: yes, i'm getting there :)",3,2
36537,214,"student: of course, i remember  teacher: and then the queen approves the law (it's called the royal assent). in theory, she has veto powers but she never uses it, it's a formality",3,3
36538,214,student: what does it mean i'm getting there? )  teacher: i'm getting to the point of telling you what i'm shocked about)),2,2
36539,214,"student: ok ) yes i remember about the queen's veto  teacher: well, it turns out, the queen has much more power than we ever knew! apparently, she looks at bills before they go to the parliament and she has changed / thrown away some of them, especially the ones that are not good for her. for example, if a bill means people will find out about how rich she is or there is a danger that she will lose some of her land / powers she vetoes some bills before they even get to the parliament!",4,4
36540,214,"student: really?  teacher: this was a new investigation, and this practice is completely undemocratic, of course, and means that the queen has much more power than anybody thought yes, the investigation was done by one of the leading newspapers, the guardian",3,3
36541,214,"student: yes, people think that she is just 'milaya starushka' )))  teacher: she apparently looked through more than 1000 bills before they got to the parliament exactly! but she is a very powerful woman, protecting her wealth and her power",3,4
36542,214,"student: during which period?  teacher: i should have said 'has looked', during her rule she has looked through more than 1000 bills since she became the queen that's good grammar now :)",3,2
36543,214,student: ))  teacher: how shocking is that?!,1,1
36544,214,"student: shocking shocking! she is not milaya starushka  teacher: exactly! :) not at all! ok, but have you seen the interview that prince harry gave to james corden, a couple of weeks ago?",3,2
36545,214,"student: is that investigation was published on the guardian website? or there is a video?  teacher: james corden is an actor, musician and tv presenter from the uk, but he moved to los angeles a while ago it's a series of articles, i'll send you links if you're curious on the guardian website, yes!",3,1
36546,214,"student: no, i haven't seen it what about is it?  teacher: ah, good! because this is going to be your homework. this is the most fun royal interview i've ever seen! i'm sure you'll enjoy it and i'm going to give you some vocabulary for it in a minute when harry and meghan stepped down as royals, they moved to canada, and then they moved to la",3,3
36547,214,student: ok! )  teacher: i don't want to spoil it for you!,4,1
36548,214,"student: i see )  teacher: ok, are you ready for some new words? maybe not all of them new)",3,2
36549,214,"student: i'm ready! )  teacher: ok, the first one is 'fare': a bus fare, a train fare (the money you pay to ride on public transport) when i first moved to kyiv, a bus fare was about 2 hryvnas, and when i was leaving, it was about 5 :)",3,3
36550,214,student: )  teacher: what's the underground fare these days?,1,1
36551,214,"student: i think the underground fare is 8 uah now  teacher: oh my goodness! i think it used to be 1 uah but still, it's much cheaper than london transport fares :)",3,2
36552,214,"student: i'n not sure because now i don't have to use the metro and i try to avoid it because it's crowded  teacher: i can imagine! ok, next one!",2,1
36553,214,"student: it's chipper you are right )  teacher: if you imagine a crown (like the one the queen wears), it's very heavy because it's made of metal and is decorated with..... shiny beautiful very expensive stones called 'gems' /dem/",4,3
36554,214,"student: aha! i see  teacher: ok, and if you're a tourist in london, you can go to some famous places, like trafalgar square, hyde park etc. etc., but also, you can find some less famous and less crowded places that are still very interesting places like these are called 'hidden gems' they are very interesting, but not many people know about them!",3,3
36555,214,"student: ok! a very goo explanation actually good  teacher: ok, cool, i'm going to be moving on quite fast, so that we have the time for all the words. next one! an obstacle course it's a race in which runners have to climb over things, jump, hit a target etc. etc. not just run",4,2
36556,214,"student: i see  teacher: maybe the best way is to google a picture of an obstacle course but you can imagine it, right? there are obstacle courses for dogs too, for example, not just for people",3,3
36557,214,"student: it's understandable 100% )  teacher: ok, next one! as you know, harry is a prince, but his official title is the duke of sussex and meghan is....?? (the female version of duke) the duchess the duchess of sussex",4,2
36558,214,"student: i see  teacher: by the way, harry calls her 'meg' in the interview (just to help with understanding when you're listening). and their little son is archie not a very common royal name at all :)",3,3
36559,214,"student: hahaha how old is he actually? ! year old?  teacher: 1,5 i think",2,2
36560,214,"student: 1.0  teacher: yes, something like that",1,1
36561,214,"student: aha, thank you  teacher: ok, next one! if someone find the love of their life, this person is 'the one' for them james corden asks harry, 'when did you realize that meghan was the one?'",3,3
36562,214,"student: aha, ok )))  teacher: the one' as in 'the one and only', 'the best one' yes, it's quite intuitive ok, and if two people meet and like each other straightaway, we can say that they 'hit it off' it's not necessarily about a romantic relationship. i think you and me hit it off when we first met 8 (??) years ago :) at least i knew i liked you straightaway",3,3
36563,214,"student: is it just about love?  teacher: no, not only!",2,1
36564,214,"student: ah, ok. i see now )  teacher: ok, next one!",2,0

36568,214,"student: yes, i know )  teacher: but if it's non-fiction, it's about history, science etc. what actually happened / what is actually true ok, cool!",3,1
36569,214,"student: i see  teacher: and also, a book / film can be based on a true story or maybe 'loosely based on' a true story",3,1
36570,214,"student: bris prefers to write non-fiction books ) boris  teacher: it's not very accurate, but it's loosely based on the truth yes, the churchill book is non-fiction i guess. if he tried to be accurate about history",3,2
36571,214,"student: ok, so loosely based it's like based on truth but not 100% i see  teacher: yes, it's maybe 70% :)",3,1
36572,214,"student: haha ) ok ))  teacher: ok, in the interview harry talks about 'public service'. the life of a royal is given to public service. public service means things that are done for the people of the country, such as hospitals, libraries, schools, charities etc. trying to improve the life of people without making money out of it",3,3
36573,214,"student: i see  teacher: ok, an easy one hysterical = very funny",3,1
36574,214,"student: )) not the same in ukrainian or russian )  teacher: well, this is not always the meaning, but in the way harry uses it no, not the same at all! it's so funny that you become hysterical and can't stop laughing. something like that)) ok, one last word! a waffle! do you know 'waffles'?",3,3

36580,214,"student: same!  teacher: ok, i'm sending you the link. the only thing i'm going to say, the subtitles are not good quality at all (probably auto-generated), so i would strongly recommend to listen without them and also, if you re-read the new words before you listen, that should help",3,3

36604,195,"student: ah! interesting she is like an expert there?  teacher: she worked with the russian campus, so i always thought their ideas were aligned",3,2
36605,195,"student: aligned - same? i'm sorry can you give me 2 mins? just a small pause  teacher: i don't think there is a definite age! it's nice for a child to have some friends, but the main idea is that they should have enough adults in her life. <student's child> is a very lucky girl, with her parents, her nanny, her grandparents, aunts, uncles and an older cousin :) yes, if two or more things are aligned, they are in the same line. remember we talked about the words aligned / misaligned? i can't remember what the topic was now! yes, of course",3,3
36606,195,student: i'm here sorry )  teacher: no problem,2,1
36607,195,"student: remember we talked about the words aligned / misaligned? - actually no ( sorry  teacher: sorry, it could have been with another student, i can't remember, one sec",2,2
36608,195,"student: but the main idea is that they should have enough adults in her life. <student's child> is a very lucky girl, with her parents, her nanny, her grandparents, aunts, uncles and an older cousin :) - oh, thank you! i like the idea and i feed better now )) feel  teacher: if you put two things in a straight line, you align them /lan/",1,3
36609,195,"student: sorry, it could have been with another student, i can't remember, one sec - maybe i've forgotten the word ) it could be me )  teacher: yoga instructors talk about alignment a lot. for example, your knee should be aligned with your second toe in some poses etc.",3,2
36610,195,"student: i see  teacher: and it can also mean 'agree' the country's leading intellectuals tend to be aligned with the opposition. an example from the dictionary the opposite is misaligned. if the wheels of a car are misaligned, it's not very nice to drive",3,3
36611,195,"student: aha! thank you  teacher: yes, speaking of children, i feel very lucky that <teacher's child> is so young. he loves the lockdowns and just 'hanging out with mum and dad'. if he was a teenager, it would be a different story!",3,2
36612,195,"student: sure i can't imagine what to do with a teenager in the same situation )  teacher: i know, it would be crazy! by march, <teacher's child> will have been home 9 months out of 12!",3,2
36613,195,"student: wow it's better don't think about )  teacher: yes, the first lockdown started in march. nearly 12 months",2,2
36614,195,"student: i mean don't count )  teacher: it's better not to think about it, yes",3,1
36615,195,"student: yeah! it's about a year from the first lockdown  teacher: ok, let's think about something fun! we started talking about bookshops last time",4,3
36616,195,student: yes!  teacher: have you got a favourite bookshop? in kyiv or abroad?,3,4
36617,195,"student: hm, it's a difficult question we don't have lots of bookshops here in kiev there are lots of online bookshops but it's too expensive to rent a place for a shop here in kyov so usually the boys in 'real' bookshops cost more and peal prefer to buy them online  teacher: ah yes, it's easier for them to operate online then? yes, i see!",3,3
36618,195,"student: and bookshops are closing is it right expression? i'm not sure  teacher: that's a shame! and i suppose, if the rent is so expensive, they haven't got any space to put small cafes in bookshops, for example yes, it is the right expression!",3,2
36619,195,"student: so it's like vicious circle a vicious circle  teacher: yes, another good expression :)",3,2
36620,195,"student: i've googled it )  teacher: books are too expensive, people don't buy them and bookshops go out of business",3,1
36621,195,student: yes!  teacher: do many people read e-books?,3,3
36622,195,"student: so we have several chains of bookshops bukva' bookling' booking is more about english language books but i hate the service  teacher: and most importantly, there is petrivka :)))",3,2
36623,195,"student: they never know what they have in the shop )))  teacher: oh, that's silly!",3,1
36624,195,"student: and most importantly, there is petrivka :))) - yes! but i haven't been there for 100 years ) can i say like this in english?  teacher: yes, you can!",3,2
36625,195,"student: <teacher> : oh, that's silly! - yes! i know better than a shop assistant! i hate it )  teacher: yes, i think petrivka is an equivalent of english independent book sellers i don't know the statistics, but i suspect most people in the uk buy books off amazon. it's cheap, convenient and there is an almost unlimited choice.",2,3
36626,195,"student: i see  teacher: then there are big chains like waterstones (i'm sure you've seen waterstones). they are nice, and the big ones have cafes and children departments are fun, children can play and read books there. there is a very nice one in cambridge but just yesterday, i read something disappointing about how staff is treated at waterstones! so we might buy less from them",3,2
36627,195,"student: wow, i like it. we need the same here  teacher: we buy from blackwells, their online service is very good and they are not amazon! yes, you'd love it! you should visit a big waterstones next time you're in the uk and also, there are small independent bookshops (or small chains). life is hard for them, but they sometimes have amazing books!",3,3
36628,195,student: maybe it's a good idea for business here in kyiv  teacher: sometimes antiquarian maybe!!,3,1
36629,195,"student: after the covid era ))  teacher: yes, and i know who can do it :)",3,2
36630,195,"student: i meran a cafe plus a bookshop plus a children space  teacher: yes, perfect! in china there is a cafe in every bookshop!",3,3
36631,195,"student: i like the idea  teacher: people meet there, read together, hold club meetings etc.",3,3
36632,195,"student: because cafes are veeeery popular here  teacher: and of course, if there's a cafe, you can invite bands / poets / musicians / writers to play / give talks",3,4
36633,195,"student: not now but before )  teacher: yes, kyiv is full of quirky little cafes!",2,2
36634,195,"student: i need to do a research ) quirky? )  teacher: ok, just a few words, and i'll leave you with another video for homework",2,3
36635,195,"student: ok!  teacher: yes, if something is quirky, it's unusual in an attractive way a quirky little cafe / bookshop",4,3
36636,195,student: ok! i see! thank you!  teacher: she likes to dress in a quirky way etc. a similar word that also means 'old-fashioned' is quaint unusual and old-fashioned,3,2
36637,195,"student: ok!  teacher: a quaint old cottage but quaint is not always positive if you say, 'what a quaint idea!', you don't approve of the idea",3,1
36638,195,"student: aha!  teacher: it's strange, maybe in an old-fashioned or bad way ok, one more word! tumbleweed it's a plant. when it dies, it breaks off the ground and the wind rolls it around like a ball",3,2
36639,195,"student: perekatipole )  teacher: exactly :) also, if you post something on the internet, but there is not response and no likes, it's tumbleweed like this plant rolls around in an empty space, with no people",3,3
36640,195,"student: oh, interesting  teacher: or if a shop is empty, the owner (in the video) says, tumbleweed! like, this place is so empty",3,2
36641,195,"student: ok! i see!  teacher: and finally, forlorn and adjective that means 'sad and lonely'",4,2
36642,195,student: thank you!  teacher: /fln/ it's quite poetic :),3,3
36643,195,"student: )  teacher: ok, i'll send you the homework then! i hope you enjoy it, and we will speak again on monday!",3,1
36644,195,student: hank you! have a good weekend!  teacher: have a lovely weekend :) thank you,3,2
36645,195,student: bye bye xxx  teacher: bye xx,1,1
38147,132,student: hi i've just bought airpods for my money )  teacher: hi <student>! congratulations!,2,2
38148,132,student: thanks  teacher: you bought them with your pocket money you mean?,2,2
38149,132,student: yes  teacher: very cool!,1,1
38150,132,student: yeah:)  teacher: do you listen to music? or maybe podcasts / audiobooks?,3,3
38151,132,"student: i listen to music, and it is betrer to talk to friends with them *better  teacher: do you mean when you video call your friends?",2,2
38152,132,student: not only video call just to talk with them  teacher: why do you need airpods to talk to your friends? :),3,3
38153,132,"student: it is easier for example i want to play or just to talk to my friends and i need headphones but i also need to charge my phone i can't do that in the same time but now i can  teacher: oh, i see, that makes sense. you don't have to carry your phone around all the time now?",3,2
38154,132,"student: no  teacher: ok, <student>. what's the word for something we do all the time because we're used to it? it's a h----",3,3
38155,132,"student: thw hole for the charger and headphones is the dame *same there can't be to things inside of it) habit  teacher: aah, now i'm with you re: headphones / charger",3,2
38156,132,"student: yes  teacher: yes, a habit remember we were talking about 'used to do' vs. 'be used to doing'? i used to do it = i did it in the past, but no more",3,3
38157,132,"student: yeah  teacher: i'm used to doing it = it's my habit, i do it all the time",3,2
38158,132,"student: i remember  teacher: ok, can you change these sentences using 'used to do' and 'be used to doing', please? or 'get used to doing' i think i will very soon develop a habit of wearing my aipods all the time!",3,3
38159,132,"student: i used to use usual headphones hehe but now i think i will get used to using them all the time  teacher: well done! this one is about me in the past, i walked everywhere. but recently i have developed a habit of cycling to places.",3,4
38160,132,"student: nice  teacher: could you change it, please?",1,1
38161,132,"student: i used to walk everywhere but now i used to cycling everywhere  teacher: the first one is correct, but something's missing in the second one",3,2
38162,132,"student: i am used!  teacher: yes! :) next one in the past, i was often late for things. but now im in the habit of leaving the house early and arriving on time.",2,1
38163,132,"student: i used to be late for things but now i am used to leaving the house early  teacher: well done! another one in the past, i ate a lot of chocolate. and im still in the habit of eating chocolate every day!",3,2
38164,132,student: i used to eat a lot of chocolate and i am still used to eating chocolate every day!  teacher: uh-uh! caught you!,3,3
38165,132,"student: where  teacher: the situation hasn't changed, has it? so we can't use 'i used to eat chocolate' because i still eat loads of it!",2,2
38166,132,"student: okay  teacher: we can say, i've always been eating a lot of chocolate / i'm used to eating lots of chocolate it started in the past and it's still true! what about your habits? i bet you've got a lot of positive habits because you're very organized and get so many things done!",3,3
38167,132,"student: i am used to using my phone to much wgen i am doing my homework it is a bad habjt  teacher: ah, yes, it's a big distraction!",3,2
38168,132,student: i am used oy i am used to making  teacher: that's because phones are so good at getting our attention!,2,1
38169,132,"student: myself writing all the homework to my dairy (schoil dairy ) oops not dairy  teacher: aha, that sounds like a very positive habit!",3,2
38170,132,student: diary  teacher: diary))),1,1
38171,132,"student: yes  teacher: yes, dairy products are those that are made of milk)",2,2
38172,132,student: but everyone are asking about the homework every day  teacher: you're used to writing your homework ___ in your diary,3,2
38173,132,student: i know out ?  teacher: down write something down,1,1
38174,132,student: aaaa i understand  teacher: i'm sure you've heard it before,2,1
38175,132,"student: yes  teacher: what are some other good habits that you have? oh maybe a new habit that you've developed? i got used to recycling, for example",4,3
38176,132,"student: i used to bring a lot of seashells from the sea on the holidays , but now i don't  teacher: aww, i still do that! :) good example!",3,2
38177,132,student: i am used to going to slepp *sleep very lately  teacher: very late? lately = recently,3,1
38178,132,"student: late i didn't know  teacher: ah, yes, it's a teenage thing :) i'm old, so i go to sleep early :) i'm used to getting 8 hours of sleep. if i don't get enough sleep, i'm tired and grumpy the next day!",3,3
38179,132,"student: you're not old  teacher: no, not very old yet, thank you :)",3,2
38180,132,student: heh  teacher: what about recycling? do you think recycling can become a habit for people in ukraine?,3,3
38181,132,"student: 7-8 hours it is not enough for me((( i think it can and i would love it so much  teacher: no, you probably need 9-10 hours of sleep, right?",3,2
38182,132,"student: yes  teacher: definitely! i know people didn't use to recycle, but maybe this situation has changed?",3,1
38183,132,"student: yes for example , in italy there are a lot of different bins for recycling  teacher: yes, sure. are there recycling bins in ukraine now? i haven't been there for about 4 years now!",3,2
38184,132,student: wow that's a lot i saw some it is not enough  teacher: they are not available everywhere?,2,1
38185,132,"student: yes  teacher: i see! that's a shame! hopefully, this can change soon!",3,1
38186,132,"student: nea r my house there some bins like 'plastic paper wood and glass' and 'organical' i hipe too *hope  teacher: aha, organic waste",2,2
38187,132,student: yes  teacher: just to go back for a moment,2,1
38188,132,student: okie  teacher: i'm __ the habit ___ having a cup of coffee every morning',2,2
38189,132,"student: in , of?  teacher: yes, correct! i ____ a habit of drinking a cup of coffee' = got used to doing it we need a verb in the gap",2,3
38190,132,"student: have oy no used to have  teacher: ah, i'm actually looking for a verb to go with 'habit' we can start a habit / develop a habit or have a habit start and develop - if it's a new habit",4,2
38191,132,"student: have goes with habit  teacher: yes, it does!",2,1
38192,132,"student: here it is bot to start of develop *not  teacher: yes, correct! either of them would work ok, <student>, i'll let you go. have a lovely weekend! talk to you on tuesday",3,2
38193,132,"student: okie, bye!  teacher: bye!",1,0
38195,211,student: hello!  teacher: hi <student>! how's it going?,3,1
38196,211,"student: everything good thank you :) how about you?  teacher: good, thank you! the lockdown's been getting to me this week though...",3,2
38197,211,"student: oh, i am sorry about that...do you know how long will it last?  teacher: well, schools are re-opening next monday, which is some normality i suppose. and i'll be able to see other people at pick-up and drop-off! we bought a new car a few weeks ago, but we aren't allowed to go anywhere until march 29 which is going to be the second phase of unlocking",3,3
38198,211,"student: well, school is a start..to think that now we are counting on the opportunity to see other parents when bringing children to school...  teacher: i know, goodness! just to see other human beings!",3,2
38199,211,"student: i see...here things are more relaxed now, but you need to do a quick test for almost everything...for istance, if i want to go to the office, i have to test every second day.  teacher: i'm very lucky to be locked down with a family, of course. i can't imagine what it's like for single people!",2,3
38200,211,"student: i agree on that one..sometimes i wish for some silence but, to be honest, i believe people living alonge have it much harder...  teacher: hmm, interesting! the country must be well stocked up on instant tests have you been going to the office? yes, you seem way ahead in terms of being out of lockdown! they haven't even offered a timeframe on the return to offices here",1,4
38201,211,"student: yes, they are aiming at doing 3 million per week or so, in a country with something like 8.5 million inhabitants.  teacher: is that all? i thought austria had a bigger population! there are about 66 million in the uk",3,2
38202,211,"student: so far i didn't go: it has opened starting today, but i couldn't get the test done...my wife had the astrazeneca vaccine and suffered from a bad fever as a side effect... so the last three days were intense ;)  teacher: oh i see, sorry to hear that!! hope she'll feel better very soon!",3,4
38203,211,"student: today she is better, in fact she is currently out with the children...some silence, finally ;) yes, austria is small..especially when you think that wien and its surroundings count 2.5 million inhabitants...  teacher: interesting! english people spell it 'vienna'",3,3
38204,211,"student: you are right, also italian people do...and also austrian actually... i don't know why i went for the german spelling...  teacher: anyway, the vaccine is a milestone even if it comes at a cost, congratulations to your wife!",2,2
38205,211,student: thanks :)  teacher: the austrians spell it differently from the germans? i didn't know that either,3,3
38206,211,"student: one thing that i can't really understand is that in italy they consider university staff as high priority, so a lot of my ex-collegues have been vaccinated...even though they are working remotely most of the time and barely see anyone the official german is wien, i believe...but austrian tend to have also 'their' version of some words... and i have heard them say vienna..  teacher: ah, they've adopted the occupation-based approach then. it's strictly age-based in the uk, the only exception being people with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable",3,4
38207,211,"student: yes, but currently they are vaccinating people over 80, medical stuff...and then, before school teachers (who see their pupils at school) they went for university staff...  teacher: i've been thinking about you saying 'silence', as in a break from the kids. i would use 'quiet' instead. or 'peace and quiet'",2,2
38208,211,"student: i don't really understand the ratio...but then, there is little i can do, i only hope that things will speed up :) oh, okay...i guess silence is more of a literary word?  teacher: oh, now that i'm thinking about it, they vaccinated medical professionals in the first group as well. but school teachers, police etc. don't get a priority, a decision that meets with a lot of criticism silence and quiet (as a noun) are very close, but silence is about the act of not uttering a sound while quiet is about the enjoyable perception of the lack of loud noises if it makes any sense",3,3
38209,211,"student: it does..i had never appreciated the difference, thank you for the description! so it would be 'i remained silent/in silence' vs 'the house is quiet'  teacher: i just feel it would be more 'english' to say, ah, some peace and quiet at last! (kids are in bed or something like that) yes, exactly! your examples are spot-on",3,2
38210,211,"student: that was just a simple example...but thank you!  teacher: great, shall we go to the last exercise in the use of english part of the test? and then i've prepared a bit of linguistic deliciousness for you :)",4,3
38211,211,"student: yes! let me find the file  teacher: please, it's page 6 in the pdf",2,1
38212,211,"student: part 4, found it!  teacher: lovely! key word tranformation, probably the trickiest 'use of english' task. which is reflected in the fact that each sentence gets two points, not one, like in the previous tasks i mean when it's being marked",2,3
38213,211,"student: i see...let's try 25. no telling 25. no telling how long  teacher: you can use 3-8 words for the gap, and the challenge is to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible",3,2
38214,211,"student: nope...i have to think a bit longer for these indeed... 25. no telling how long it  teacher: yes, correct! the last option",3,1
38215,211,"student: 26. is little demand for  teacher: yes, good!",2,1
38216,211,"student: 27. impressed by how good great a (i am not 100% sure about the preprositions 'by' here) 28. resignation came as a surprise to (29 later) 30. the height of his power  teacher: hold on, 27. the preposition is good! also with / at are possible. but 'good' doesn't quite convey the meaning, the answer is 'skilled' or 'skillful'",3,3
38217,211,student: interesting...actually i work also on paraphrase problem  teacher: 28 = correct,0,1
38218,211,"student: and changing 'skill' with 'good' is the sort of mistake i expect from my models...i should have read the sentence twice! thank you for pointing it out 29. was not a tree whatsoever in i am really not sure about 29, i am wondering if i should keep the word 'vegetation'  teacher: yes, this task is different from others, in that paraphrasing is actually discouraged exactly, good idea! there was no vegetation whatsoever in/ there was nothing whatsoever growing in because there could have been a bush / flower, not necessarily a tree and the same issue in 30. how would you change your answer to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible?",4,3
38219,211,"student: i see...i was thinking that 'a tree whatsoever' would convey the meaning of 'a tree or anything similar'...but maybe my understanding of the word whatsoever isn't correct. at the height of his success, where i am not sure how you spell 'success'...anyway  teacher: oh no, whatsoever just means 'absolutely none', it's a way of amplifying 'no'. he has no money/ friends whatsoever. yes, at the height of his success!",3,2
38220,211,"student: okay :) it was difficult indeed...and, at least from this first attempt, i'd say keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem. is the most difficult part of the problem.  teacher: oh, exactly, and you got all the expressions they are looking for right, i think it's about learning the logic of the task in writing and speaking, the situation is reverse. you are expected to paraphrase, especially at this level of proficiency for example, if the examiner asks you, 'do you prefer to spend time on your own or with friends?' in a speaking test,",3,3
38221,211,"student: which means i should definitely prepare for the exam, it shouldn't be too difficult.  teacher: it would be a bit of a waste of opportunity to start saying, 'i prefer to spend my time with friends...' because you've just repeated the question and haven't shown off your english when you could have said, 'i'm quite gregarious, and i'm most in my element among people'",3,2
38222,211,"student: i see...  teacher: but in key word transformation, only the necessary paraphrasing!",2,1
38223,211,"student: okay! it is so difficult for me to talk about my free time i mean, in the current situation...  teacher: haha, yes, i can imagine! it's just an example",3,2
38224,211,"student: i enjoy both company and solitude, even though i would normally tend towards the latter. i enjoy studying and learning. but now i have children and i am under a light lockdown, so i am always with my children...  teacher: but again, the skill for the speaking task is to talk at length in a way that shows off your language on any topic. the good news is, you don't ever have to be truthful, just whatever gives your english a chance to shine! for example, i wouldn't really describe myself as gregarious, but it was the first c2 word that came to my mind, and i went with it",4,3
38225,211,"student: haha, i know...this reminds me of hugh laurie, when he auditioned for dr house he lied about where he was staying, because he felt like 'chicago' was too difficult to say with an american accent (i believe it was chicago) i see...well, if latin words are a plus, it shouldn't be difficult for me...  teacher: oh really? love it! (and love hugh laurie, one of my favourite actors)",4,4
38226,211,"student: yes...it was one of his interviews, but finding it now would be like looking for the needle in a haystack  teacher: ah, speaking of words! the promised linguistic treat have you ever heard of tom swift books / jokes? yes, a needle in a haystack, true!",3,3
38227,211,"student: no i haven't heard of him...  teacher: i've never read the books, but they are apparently sci-fi for teenagers or something like that but! they gave birth to a whole series of jokes that mimick the style of the book the jokes are based on puns (do you know this one?)",3,2
38228,211,"student: no, i don't know it sorry...  teacher: a play on the fact that a particular word has more than one meaning i'll give you an example what's black and white and red (= read) all over? - a newspaper",3,3
38229,211,"student: oh, now i see! sorry...  teacher: this is a pun based on the fact that 'red' and 'read' have the same pronunciation",3,2
38230,211,"student: i though you were asking about thi series of jokes, i assumed this was also published as a book or something... okay, i actually knew that a 'pun' was some sort of joke, but i didn't know it involved word's meaning in particular.  teacher: oh sorry, i confused you! no, i was just trying to say that 'tom said' jokes are based on some wordplay ok, let's have a look at a couple of jokes, i wonder if you know both meaning of words...",4,4
38231,211,"student: okay!  teacher: 'i'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' tom said cryptically. here, the play is on the fact that a crypt is a burial place, like a mausoleum, but cryptically means 'with an air of mystery' does it make sense?",3,3
38232,211,"student: haha...okay, cryptically refers both to in a manner of speaking, as if hiding something, and refers to crypts? the old cemetery yes  teacher: yes!! i needn't have explained it to you :) another one 'pass me the shellfish,' said tom crabbily.",4,3
38233,211,"student: hmm...this time you need to explain me...or better, i am pretty sure that crabbiliy refers also to crabs but i don't know the other meaning of the word  teacher: well, yes, it comes from 'crab', but it means grumpy and bad-tempered!",4,4
38234,211,student: i see  teacher: good non-latin word)) the boss is well crabby today or something like that,1,2
38235,211,"student: haha...okay, i will remember this one!  teacher: ok, one last! aaand the chatroom decided to crash!",3,3
38236,211,"student: i see indeed that's the case  teacher: ah, i'll have to let you go. would you like to do the reading tasks in the same pdf? if you have the time i mean as homework",3,2
38237,211,"student: okay, i will try to do them! yes, now i have a call  teacher: great! ok, sorry, talk to you next week!",3,1
38239,253,student: hi <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you? how was your trip?,3,3
38240,253,"student: hi! i am good thank you :) it was great! a bit tiring though: we met with a lot of relatives... how about you? how are you?  teacher: sounds lovely! well, i had my first dose a week ago, so yay! of the covid vaccine i mean",3,4
38241,253,"student: of course...austria just sent the appointments to everyone who asked for the vaccine: i am getting my first dose in a month :)  teacher: otherwise, we keep waiting for some sun, maybe we'll finally glimpse it this weekend yay! a wait, but at least you have a date i suppose",3,3
38242,253,"student: that's true! the weather was terrible in italy too...we had only two days without rain  teacher: really? well, if even italy is all rainy, it kind of makes me feel a bit better :)",3,2
38243,253,"student: haha...in italy we have a saying 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy)  teacher: haha, exactly! :) i wonder what the saying is in english, there should be something...",3,3
38244,253,"student: but i didn't have time for the writing, sorry...we really travelled a lot! miserly loves company...maybe (i found it with google, i didn't know it)  teacher: no worries! i'm taking the next week off teaching because my son will be on holiday, so if you still want to do it, you'll have some extra time",2,2
38245,253,"student: that's great! agreed!  teacher: yes, kind of 'misery loves company', hmmm but the italian one is more joyful!",3,3
38246,253,"student: yes, at least it mentions something that isn't misery..  teacher: lovely! also, i am sad to say that we will be closing the teaching project on june 18, which means that we will only have the time for two classes, between june 7 and june 18",3,1
38247,253,"student: i see :) okay, well it was a nice opportunity so i can only be thankful abou it and i am curious to see what sort of reserach they do on the papers: i'll follow the professor who i first contacted for this opportunity ;)  teacher: yes, it's been a pleasure on my part, and of course, we are very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself",3,2
38248,253,"student: it's been a pleasure for me too!  teacher: i think they're taking the research in more than one direction at the moment. yes, i'm sure you can contact <researcher> for more information if you're curious, he did mention it",3,2
38249,253,"student: cool, thank you :) it would be cool if i eventually end up working also on the data i contributed to generate...  teacher: ok, so the question is, what would you like to focus on in our remaining time? i've been planning to look at some more speaking questions from c2 proficiency today",3,3
38250,253,"student: (if they release it openly) okay, let's look at speaking questions!  teacher: yes, <researcher> would be a better person to speak to about this than myself! it would be cool if i eventually end up working also on the data i contributed to generate i feel that 'also' is a bit out of place here. what would be a better place for it?",2,2
38251,253,"student: oh, the also is in the wrong position there, right? yep  teacher: haha, yes! you see it yourself, don't you?",3,1
38252,253,"student: i could either remove it, or...maybe...i could put it before 'working': end up also working ...  teacher: yes! i like it before 'working'.",3,2
38253,253,"student: yes and no...but now, everytime i write it an alarm bel rings in my head so i try to pay more attention (not in that case, apparently)  teacher: also working' - like other researchers it's german interference, isn't it? i can just hear 'arbeiten auch' in my mind",3,3
38254,253,"student: yes...moreover german has an interjection which is written 'also', has a slightly different sound... the way we use 'anche' in italian, which is the closes word to 'also' we have, is also different...  teacher: aah, yes, i remember! indeed",3,2
38255,253,student: so it is really tricky for me ;)  teacher: i can imagine!,3,1
38256,253,"student: *the closest anyway, practise makes perfect :) as you see if i think about it i am starting to correct it!  teacher: ok, c2 questions! i think i mentioned last time that there are several parts to the speaking test, and in the first part the questions are focused on you rather than abstract i'm warning you, some of them are a bit weird, you'll have to just roll with them and show off your english!",4,3
38257,253,"student: okay, that's fine!  teacher: you'll see what i mean (i'll start with not so weird ones though) the test always begins with, please tell us your name, are you a student or do you work and then maybe 'where are you from', no need to answer those now next question: you said you are from friulli (did i get that right??) is that an interesting place to live?",3,4
38258,253,"student: those are the easy ones.. yes, i am originally from friuli (just one 'l').  teacher: yep, they give the examiner a chance to fill in the papers :) sorry! friuli",3,3
38259,253,"student: it depends on what you mean by 'interesting'. it is a small, rural region which was among the poorest in italy before the so called italian economic miracle of the sixties...  teacher: ok, lovely! feel free to add another sentence or two",3,4
38260,253,"student: i find it interesting because you can experience nature in all its forms: from mountains, to the sea side...and, as any place in italy, it has many places that are interesting as far as history is concerned. for instance trieste, with castle miramare, or palmanova: a small city which still has the original footprint from the middle ages and looks like a star, surrounded by its wals, when you look at it from a map. in this sense it is quite interesting :) but i would use the word quiet to describe it: if you look for a thrilling night life you should look somewhere else.  teacher: ok, thanks! great sophisticated grammar, i like it! it would be helpful to use some synonyms to 'interesting' though, such as...",3,3
38261,253,"student: (maybe when you see an aerial view would be a better way to say 'look from a map')  teacher: what comes to your mind? yes, sure, because you mean 'look at its map', but an aerial view is a better expression!",4,2
38262,253,"student: oh..i didn't think about synonyms...this is a trick i should remember... to be honest i don't have many synonyms...maybe stimulating, in certain contexts? noteworthy  teacher: yes, you would probably use 'interesting' in real life, and so would a native speaker, but you aren't scoring any points with it in the test as you can imagine!",3,3
38263,253,"student: okay! but i should probably exercise with synonyms because it isn't that easy (even when looking at italian synonyms for help ;) )  teacher: i find it interesting... could be replaced with something like 'it appeals to me' noteworthy is a good one! and then all kind of descriptive adjectives, like 'fascinating' etc. there is a lot unpack / explore in terms of history etc.",2,4
38264,253,"student: indeed...i should exercise by paraphrasing questions  teacher: ok, let's try another one!",3,2
38265,253,"student: into ones that use more refined terms.  teacher: exactly, with that in mind how good are you at organising your time?",3,3
38266,253,"student: scheduling my day is a fundamental task for me: i have a busy life, with two small children, and i can't expect things to work out without any planning.  teacher: excellent! great paraphrasing",3,2
38267,253,"student: therefore i'd answer saying i am good at planning my day, even when this means handling unexpected events. which are common among parents of small children.  teacher: lovely! a good expression: firefighting (especially in the work context) dealing with problems that pop up unexpectedly too much time is spent firefighting rather than moving the business forward. an example from the dictionary",3,3
38268,253,"student: oh, that's a lovely expression! and i am not sure i've ever encountered it...i'll write it down :)  teacher: yes, very useful! my husband says it all the time, when he's annoyed that he hasn't made any progress because he's been firefighting the minor crises ok, the next one! what would you dream job be? (they are eliciting conditionals and the grammar of speculations like could / might here!)",4,4
38269,253,"student: if i had the possibility to go back in time, i would try to focus my efforts into becoming a pilot with the final objective of becoming an astronaut. i might have actually attempted to follow this passion of mine if it was not for my parents who are scared of flying... and made it very clear that, if i was to flight, they would be in a constant state of alert and fear. (okay, i exaggerated a bit, but it was just to show off some language)  teacher: excellent! just one objection. third conditional: i might have attempted, it it ___ ___ ___ for my parents (because it's in past) *in the past",3,3
38270,253,"student: if it were not for my parents?  teacher: if it had not been! the pure third conditional is 'past perfect, if would / might / could have v3'",3,2
38271,253,"student: okay..i guess i'll have to check it again..  teacher: i'll make a note, if we've got some time left, we can do a bit of third conditional practice in june but otherwise great! ok, are you ready for the weird one? how important is the internet for you?",3,3
38272,253,student: i must say i was expecting a weirder question...  teacher: really? i've got to up my game :) i thought this was weird!,4,2
38273,253,"student: the internet is fundamental for me: sometimes i am scared when thinking about how much of my activities rely on it: from working, to listening to music and shopping...  teacher: the best answer to this would be, 'excuse me, inte... what?' sorry, go on!",3,1
38274,253,"student: i can hardly move a stone without connecting to some server to check how many steps i've taken today or using a neural network to try an identify the species of the insect that is strolling through my porch... haha...agreed! i'll write down that answer... maybe 20 years ago...  teacher: no, don't write it down! :))",3,2
38275,253,"student: nowadays even driving a car often relies on an internet connection, if not for the driving itself, at least for the directions  teacher: love the vocabulary! brilliant! and you managed to avoid using the word 'important'))",3,3
38276,253,"student: i was joking ;) thank you! i must say that i should exercise a bit, as currently my words are stirred more by the will to produce outstanding english rather than saying what i mean to say haha but, as you said, the examiners don't know anything about me, they are there only to evaluate my english  teacher: exactly! i wouldn't worry about truthfulness here!",3,2
38277,253,"student: good :) i guess i have to go now, right? what time in 2 weeks? i should be available again on tuesday  teacher: will tuesday suit you? tuesday june 8?",2,1
38278,253,"student: yes at 1 pm?  teacher: lovely, at 1 pm? yes, absolutely, because i won't have to reload the chatroom afterwards",3,2
38279,253,"student: perfect! see you then...enjoy the vacation!  teacher: great, i'll speak to you then! thank you :)",3,3
38280,253,student: and thank you!! bye!!  teacher: bye!,2,2
38282,37,"student: good afternoon <teacher>.  teacher: hi there <student>, everything ok with you?",3,2
38283,37,"student: yes, i am health.  teacher: ok great, i;m pleased you're healthy!",3,1
38284,37,"student: just stay at hotel by myself for 14 days, and nurses are take care of everyone.  teacher: oh right - so you're in quarantine for 2 weeks?! but have you tested negative?",3,3
38285,37,"student: absolute, i for 2 weeks. yes, the test was negative  teacher: ok right but you still have to stay isolated??? is that logical?",3,2
38286,37,student: i think so...  teacher: ok well anyway - i hope you cam make the best of it and don't get too down....!,3,1
38287,37,student: thanks !! i think you need take care if yourself too...!  teacher: yeah don't worry i'll be fine!,2,2
38288,37,"student: ok~~~that great  teacher: ok <student>, shall l we do some ielts magic?!",3,3
38289,37,"student: of cause, let do it  teacher: ok great - so if you can face it, let's go back to the pie charts ok? can you give me a sentence about coal in france in 1980 please? just that nothing else ok?",3,2
38290,37,student: ok coal accounted for 25% of electricity in france in 1980 coal made up for 25% of electricity in france in 1980.  teacher: yes thanks <student> that's great language well done ....be careful with the proportion though! check the units ok? is it really 25%?,3,3
38291,37,"student: wow, it is not 100 units... sorry, my internet became slowly just now  teacher: no that's ok....so no, it's not 100 units... how can you say it then?",3,2
38292,37,"student: so...approximately 27% of electricity form/by coal.  teacher: ok thanks... wow, you could try and work it out like that if you like....maybe an easier way would be to say e.g. 25 out of 90 units or more than a quarter ...ok?",3,3
38293,37,student: ok  teacher: so in fact <student> fractions (half/third/quarter etc) are good to use for variety in language ok? so for example ...52% = just _____ half?,3,2
38294,37,student: just more than half just exceeding half  teacher: can you try it with just one word in the gap? beginning with 'o'!,3,3
38295,37,student: just over half  teacher: yes thanks! i think that's best.. it is best!,1,2
38296,37,"student: ok,thanks  teacher: and what about e.g. 23%?",2,3
38297,37,student: just over third. just over fifth  teacher: yes! or just ________ a quarter?,2,3
38298,37,student: just less a quarter  teacher: so if you say 'less' you need to say 'less than' ....so just use one word ok? beginning with 'u'!,3,2
38299,37,student: just u.... a quarter  teacher: opposite of 'over',1,1
38300,37,student: i am not sure that word..  teacher: under! just under a quarter,2,2
38301,37,student: haha...thanks  teacher: ok!,1,1
38302,37,student: just under a quarter  teacher: yes that's it good...so by the way you need 'a' before all fractions except for 'half' (although it's possible to out it in for 'half' too) so e.g. a third/a quarter,3,3
38303,37,"student: ok, i got it  teacher: when it's just one i mean...actually 'one' is correct too right? so a/one third etc but e.g. two fifths/three quarters etc ...obviously without 'a' so <student>...last individual one...what about coal in australia in 2000?! tell me about that in one sentence (try a fraction if you like too)",4,4
38304,37,"student: ok, it is a very different way to explain date  teacher: do you mean fractions?",1,1
38305,37,student: cola was 130 out of 170 units in australia in 2000  teacher: ok fine...hol don hold on i mean!,1,0
38306,37,student: ok  teacher: so yes fine - good to get that little structure 'out of' correct ! or ... e.g. coal accounted for 130 out of 170 units of electricity or e.g. coal generated 130 out of 170 units,3,1
38307,37,"student: ok, i understand,,thanks  teacher: and the passive structure? remember that possibility? so e.g. 130 out of 170 units of electricity...(can you finish this one?)",3,2
38308,37,student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity form/by coal.  teacher: yes ok but you need a verb somewhere!,3,1
38309,37,student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity was produced from/by coal  teacher: yes ok good thanks! because it's units it is plural so we need 'were produced from' (good to use verb 'produced' by the way),3,2
38310,37,"student: ok,i got it,thanks  teacher: ok <student> so let's take another step here ok? so we have given the basic numbers for coal in 2000 (130 out of 170 units) ...but what does really mean? it's good if we can say that in words you know? what i mean is ...in bad english we might say: 'yes coal really big 2000' do you see? but in good ielts english we could say...? not the numbers just this idea in words",3,3
38311,37,"student: coal was by far the most popular fuel, with 130 out of 170 units were produced.  teacher: thanks <student> - a very good sentence overall...hold on",3,2
38312,37,student: ok  teacher: so if we make 2 basic correct sentences we could get: coal was by far the most significant (better than 'popular' here because people aren't actually choosing it like coca cola you see?) fuel. it produced 130 out of 170 units. ok?,3,3
38313,37,"student: ok, it is better than my sentence.  teacher: well yes i guess so! but we can take one more step if we like....look at the one coming up...can you see i have deleted the full stop and the verb - you just need to change the form of the verb ..can you try it?coal was by far the most significant fuel, _________ 130 out of 170 units so e.g. 'produce/produced/producing'? you decide!",4,3
38314,37,"student: ok, less verbs make sentences more academic. produced because it was in 2000.  teacher: ok right so i know what you mean but remember 'prodcued was in the original two sentence version but here we are changing it so we need: ...coal was by far the most significant fuel, producing130 out of 170 units have you seen that before?",3,2
38315,37,student: no.. i just could write very simple sentences before.  teacher: ok well don't worry too much - the first two-sentence version was still good and you could still get a high score with that ok?,3,1
38316,37,"student: ok hanks thanks  teacher: ok <student> before we finish this hour let me ask you one final question....can you tell me about nuclear power in france in 1980 and 2000. so you could try it like this: 'in 1980, nuclear power.....however, in 2000....' ok?!",4,3
38317,37,"student: ok.. in 1980, nuclear power accounted for 15 out of 90 units of electricity,however, in 2000, it was by far the most signifiant fuel, producing 126 out of 180 units. i think my type speed have become more quickly than a few days ago. have becoming  teacher: ooohh <student>! that's a great sentence! i'm very happy with that! perfect...a great ending...i'll see you in 15 minutes ok?",3,2
38318,37,"student: ok, see you later  teacher: ok",1,0
38320,258,student: hi olga!  teacher: hi giovanni! how are you?,2,3
38321,258,"student: good, thank you! how about you?  teacher: all good, thank you! thanks for your essay, i really enjoyed reading it! some very nice language there :) i especially liked the inverted third conditional :) had it not been for this shared trove of knowledge and rules, it would have been impossible to build todays nations where millions of people, who are de facto strangers to each other, live and thrive together. i mean this one also, it's an elegant summary of the two viewpoints, very nice",4,4
38322,258,"student: thank you :) as i explained: it took me a while to write it, but i thought that sometimes trying to perfect one's language can be a good exercise :)  teacher: yes, absolutely. if you were in a situation where you have to observe the time limit such as an exam, i'd suggest sticking to a very clear structure with topic sentences, it does speed up the process! (i would say the structure is very clear in the last two paragraphs, but the beginning is more free-flowing)",3,3
38323,258,"student: maybe i should start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph ;) it took me a long time to write it for multiple reasons, among them the fact that i rewrote someparts... *some parts  teacher: yes, a boring but reliable structure. 1. introduction (signposting early what you're going to write about) 2. topic sentence, expansion 3. topic sentence, expansion or maybe 4 too, i'm not saying there should be 3 paragraphs :)",3,2
38324,258,"student: yes, of course :) the problem is that it is difficult to be 'creative' with such a structure... since it is a topic that i'm interested in i had plenty to write about in 'my way'...but, of course, for an exam it's better to choose some topics and produce just what you're asked for :)  teacher: yes! but it's also difficult to steer away from the topic and get lost, which is a problem with a lot of exam writing (not yours, actually) yep, that's the trick! it is an interesting topic though, isn't it? and the one that's existed since the dawn of time as your video so nicely illustrates :)",4,3
38325,258,"student: yes, it is quite interesting, especially as a parent...and i think that it is becoming more and more apparent, as society changes with greater speeds...  teacher: yes, i'm sure our kids' generation will find ways to shock us even though we might be thinking now that we've seen it all",4,2
38326,258,"student: if i think about the first time i surfed the internet, i was one of the first in my little town...and now, if we have a problem, that's 'too much' internet... haha, indeed...we'll have to wait and see what they come up with  teacher: anyway, for our final lesson, have you maybe got any questions / anything you'd like to discuss / anything i can help with?",3,3
38327,258,"student: hmm...no, not really... as i told you i've bought the book you sent me via pdf, and i plan on working on it from start to finish  teacher: oh really? i must have missed it somehow! the orange one?",2,2
38328,258,"student: yes, from longman :)  teacher: i see, oh it's really good, i'm sure you'll enjoy it!",4,3
38329,258,"student: but then, if you have some exercises or interesting sayings with difficult vocabulary, that would be fine for me :) yes, i like how it is structured! and it is packed with exercises...  teacher: yes, i do have something prepared, we'll get to it in a second, just wanted to check with you first you probably do it anyway, but i do recommend reading good quality media in english, i do believe it helps with the language a lot! i know i've become a better writer because i do like my guardian articles :) what do you prefer to read in english?",3,4
38330,258,"student: i read mostly books...from biographies, to science and technology related treaties... sometimes i skim through bbc or cnn, but i find it hard to read with a attention a whole article on my mobile phone... oh, i also read a lot of scientific articles on machine learning, but the quality of the language there is mixed...  teacher: right, sure, the quality of the language is not the main point there i can imagine i think an opinion article is as close as it gets 'in real life' to those exam essays, and they're usually full of good language",3,3
38331,258,"student: it should be of some concern...but currently the pace at which articles in ml (machine learning) is out of control...which leads to lower quality in many aspects (including language) indeed...they also have the advantage of being 'short': i am used to long texts, but in real life you often need to be synthetic  teacher: interesting! you're in a very dynamic field yes, absolutely, they are quite concise and pack a lot in a small space anyway, a little something i've prepared for you to practice those past conditionals (if you have the book handy, feel free to open this chapter, the one we were working on last time) i'm going to tell you a story and invite you to speculate about what could have happened if people had acted differently :)",4,4
38332,258,"student: i would dare to say that, to a point, it is a fad...a lot of people have been blinded by the promises of artificial intelligence, money is flowing and people are trying to apply it to everything...still it is very interesting and dynamic, indeed! okay! i have the book here, but i don't remember the page...  teacher: one second, i'll find it a fad? very interesting, coming from you! as i said before, my main objection from the user side of it is 'artificial empathy'. it just doesn't work in my opinion! it's page 88 in the actual book and page 89 in the pdf ok, the story!",3,3
38333,258,"student: haha...not in all aspects, but in some, for instance empathy...or creating an artificial psychiatrist ;) yes, the story! are you still here?  teacher: it's about a poor musician called anton who lived in a small fishing village. he and the daughter of a rich fisherman, barbara, were in love, and he went to her father to ask for her hand. the father said that he had to have a boat to be able to marry his daughter and provide for her. but anton did not have a boat, only his guitar! anton went to his friend chris, a fisherman, and asked to borrow his boat. but chris refused him saying that he needed the boat for work. barbara and anton broked up. heartbroken, anton proposed to another girl, elizabeth, but elizabeth said he was still in love with barbara and turned him down. anton was unhappy and unmarried then. but who was to blame? sorry, still here, but a long story! in third conditional sentences, please :)",3,2
38334,258,"student: if anton had a boat he would have been able to support a family and barbara's father would have granted her hand.  teacher: *broke up, not broked! nearly! if anton ___ ___ a boat,",3,1
38335,258,student: had had?  teacher: yes! or barbara's father should have been more open-minded?,2,2
38336,258,student: if christ hadn't needed the boat for work he would have borrowed it to anton.  teacher: my guess is that in italian 'borrow' and 'lend' are the same verb :) he would have lent it to anton!,3,3
38337,258,student: if barbara's father had grew up in another time he would have been more open-minded and let barbara choose who to marry.  teacher: nearly! had ___ up in another time,3,2
38338,258,"student: they are indeed, but to be fair i was a bit dubious about which verb to use... grown  teacher: lend (lent, lent) = let someone temporarily have something that belongs to you borrow: borrow some money from a bank, borrow a book from the library, may i borrow your pen, please? and which of them is a synonym of 'loan'?",2,1
38339,258,"student: i see :) the difference is between the fact that you are actively 'giving' something or 'taking' something... a loan is something you ask to the bank, so i'd go for 'borrow'... but i didn't know load is a verb too  teacher: yes! like in italian, it's the same verb in my native language, so i could recognize the problem :) but there's a very clear distinction in english. also, you don't use 'have' instead of 'borrow' there's a big difference between 'you can have it' and 'you can borrow it'! if you say 'you can have it', you don't expect 'it' back!",4,2
38340,258,"student: that's quite clear to me  teacher: ok, sure! to take out a loan / apply for a bank loan means to borrow money from a bank or to try to do so",3,1
38341,258,"student: haha i know :) unless you say something like 'you can have it for a couple of days, but i need it this sunday'  teacher: but 'to loan' means 'to lend'",3,2
38342,258,"student: (i hope i'm not making up an expression) oh...okay  teacher: banks loan money yes, exactly, it would be clearer to say 'you can borrow it for a couple of days!'",3,1
38343,258,"student: so my reasoning was wrong...ok...i guess it is more formal i mean loan is used in more formal situations, right?  teacher: ooh, we're out of time!",1,2
38344,258,"student: or maybe with money/institutions?  teacher: yes, absolutely!",2,2
38345,258,"student: 13:59 on my laptop  teacher: loan is more formal! right, thank you very much for participating in this project! it's been a pleasure to chat with you over the last few months :) you've still got my email address if you'd like to contact me one day, i'll be very happy to hear from you!",4,3
38346,258,"student: thank you! it was a pleasure for me too! and also a great opportunity for me, and science :) of couse! you have my e-mail too, for instnace if you ever need some suggestions about what to visit in italy ;) thank you again! and have a great summer! bye, bye!  teacher: oh that would be so nice, i hope we can go next year! i'll definitely turn to you for suggestions thank you, and all the best to you and your family! bye <student>!",4,4
38348,88,teacher: hi <student>!  student: hello,1,0
38349,88,teacher: sorry to hear you want to sleep!  student: :),2,0
38350,88,teacher: how's life? are you still in vinnytsa?  student: everything is okay i am in kovel now,3,3
38351,88,"teacher: nice! visiting family again?  student: no, just visiting friends",3,3
38352,88,"teacher: sounds good. i've never been to kovel - is it nice?  student: yes, but is little",4,2
38353,88,teacher: ok  student: the highest house here is with 9 levels,1,1
38354,88,"teacher: ah, the tallest building  student: and there are not a lot good shops to by clothes",2,1
38355,88,teacher: there are no tall buildings in my town at all! maybe three floors maximum  student: wow i am living on the 20th floor (in kyiv),3,3
38356,88,"teacher: oh wow! but most of england is very low rise, and most houses are two floors, including ours. in a house, both floors belong to the same owner, so you have a downstairs (usually living room, dining room and kitchen) and an upstairs area (usually bedrooms)  student: yeah, i understand",3,1
38357,88,"teacher: some people live in flats, especially in big cities, and flats are usually on one level. which is probably why they are called 'flats', now that i'm thinking about it  student: i think it is better to live in a house",3,2
38358,88,teacher: and what do you call a house that has only got the ground floor?  student: what do you mean?,3,1
38359,88,teacher: do you know the word for a house that hasn't got an upstairs?  student: no,2,0
38360,88,teacher: a bungalow  student: oh,1,1
38361,88,"teacher: the stress is on the first syllable  student: i didn't now it, but i know it is the same on russian",3,2
38362,88,"teacher: old people sometimes move to bungalows because of mobility problems. but it's not just for older people, obviously it's the same ___ russian  student: in",2,1
38363,88,"teacher: yes! i've got a nice mystery picture for you today, i couldn't guess what it was! i'll send you the link on skype what do you think it could be?  student: it might be a tree?",3,2
38364,88,"teacher: good idea, but no! and a good modal verb :)  student: it might be an animal?",3,2
38365,88,"teacher: yes, closer! what kind of animal?  student: a fish?",3,1
38366,88,teacher: nope!  student: a bug?,1,1
38367,88,"teacher: warmer, warmer  student: a butterfly?",2,2
38368,88,"teacher: yes, you got it!! well done!  student: yay",4,3
38369,88,"teacher: the image is ____ (made much to look much bigger, so that you can see it in detail) sorry, 'made to look much bigger' do you remember the word? m------ed  student: mo------ed",2,2
38370,88,teacher: no! magni----  student: magnified!,3,3
38371,88,teacher: yes! and what do we call a device that allows us to see objects as if they were bigger?  student: magnifier,4,4
38372,88,"teacher: yes, or magnifying glass ok, let's quickly go through our modals of deduction. if you think it's possible that something happened, you can say 'it ___ ____ happened'  student: might have",3,3
38373,88,teacher: yes! if you are sure that this is what happened?  student: must have,2,3
38374,88,"teacher: yes, and if you are sure it didn't happen?  student: can't have",3,3
38375,88,"teacher: yes, correct! ok, i just got back from a week of holiday, could you use modals of deduction to make sentences about what i did / where i went etc.? just to practise those  student: what do you mean?",3,2
38376,88,"teacher: for example, you could say, <teacher>, you can't have been abroad because of the quarantine. you could have gone to the countryside, or something like that are you still feeling confused?  student: yes what did you mean by what you did/where you went?",3,2
38377,88,"teacher: well, you don't know what i did and where i went on holiday, right? but you might have some ideas, and that's where the modals of deduction come in.  student: like you must have been at home or you can't have been to italy",3,3
38378,88,"teacher: for example, i'll try to make sentences about your trip to vinnytsa yes, all good you must have enjoyed vinnytsa because it's quieter than kyiv you might have been a bit bored because there might have been fewer things to do than at home you can't have missed the famous vinnytsa fountains things like this  student: okay do you want me to tell you a funny story?",3,4
38379,88,teacher: please!  student: do you know smeshariki?,1,2
38380,88,teacher: the cartoon?  student: yes,2,2
38381,88,teacher: i do  student: so yesterday i was on a beach,1,3
38382,88,teacher: ok  student: and my face was very red yesterday,2,2
38383,88,teacher: did you catch the sun?  student: yes,3,1
38384,88,teacher: oh no!  student: and my friend made me funny 'things' on my head so the looked like a needles so i thought i looked like yozhik from smeshariki! ( i will have curly hair after it),4,3
38385,88,"teacher: haha, oh no! oh i see, did your friend curl your hair?  student: if you want to, i can send you how do i look like now",3,2
38386,88,"teacher: ok, on skype, right  student: it is now easy to explain",2,1
38387,88,"teacher: oh, they are almost like dreadlocks, very cool!  student: after that they must be very curly",3,0
38388,88,teacher: after that ___ must be very curly (hair)  student: it?,2,2
38389,88,"teacher: yes! like in ukrainian, right? but not like in russian  student: yeah",3,3
38390,88,"teacher: ok, <student>, something i wanted to ask you. what would you like to learn about in the rest of our classes? some topics that you find interesting or anything? because, unlike at school, we don't have to follow the book  student: some topics i find interesting everything i wrote in the form",3,2
38391,88,"teacher: what topics for example? i remember you are into chess and coding, is that right?  student: yes and math",3,3
38392,88,"teacher: are you a competitive chess player or do you play for fun? and math, yes!  student: for fun",3,2
38393,88,teacher: cool! do you enjoy any other board games?  student: monopoly,3,2
38394,88,"teacher: ok, and can you tell me a bit about your coding hobby?  student: i don't really what to say like when is it or where?",3,2
38395,88,"teacher: well, what language you use, what programmes you write  student: we use c on usual lessons we used unity",2,3
38396,88,"teacher: did you learn any of these at school?  student: but on quarantine we just used a site to train, because not all the computers can have unity in school i learn python it is absolutely different",3,2
38397,88,"teacher: oh wow, i'm impressed that python is now taught at schools!  student: it is only in our school i think:(",3,3
38398,88,"teacher: ah, i see! makes sense  student: and you must be in a c class",2,2
38399,88,teacher: what's a c class?  student: and special itc group abcd classes like 6-b,2,1
38400,88,"teacher: ah, got you  student: you see",2,0
38401,88,"teacher: ok, <student>, i'll let you go enjoy your day, thank you, and see on thursday same time?  student: okay goodbye have a nice day!",3,2
38712,168,student: <student> oops  teacher: hi <student>!,2,1
38713,168,student: hello <teacher>! i'm sorry for being late  teacher: no worries :),3,2
38714,168,student: i had a class of russian with a student and he was half hour late (  teacher: oh no! was it an online class?,3,3
38715,168,student: yes. it was in skype he's in germany and forgot about the time difference  teacher: i see! you certainly have an exciting job! (so do i i think :),3,3
38716,168,"student: depends on the student))  teacher: i wouldn't even know where to start if i was teaching russian. i mean, russian / ukrainian words just change all the time",2,2
38717,168,"student: that was me 6 years ago)))  teacher: well, i suppose this is the difference between a professional language teacher and a native speaker of the language",3,3
38718,168,"student: i also couldn't figure out how to do it i did my homework by the way right after our last lesson  teacher: oh lovely, i did the reading too :)",3,2
38719,168,"student: the task seemed pretty challenging  teacher: i've got the answer key, by the way, don't worry, i'm not just checking your answers against mine",3,2
38720,168,student: it is actually one of my least favourite tasks no worries at all)))  teacher: which one? the missing paragraphs one?,2,3
38721,168,"student: yours are as good as the answer keys yes, the missing paragraphs  teacher: i wish! i got a couple wrong with the missing paragraphs! like you say, a tough task",3,4
38722,168,"student: this type gets extra difficult starting from the advanced level  teacher: the trouble is, if you get just the one wrong, you're likely to get at least one more wrong too because you might have already used the paragraph you needed",3,3
38723,168,"student: exactly  teacher: ok, shall we have a look?",3,2
38724,168,student: yes! let me open the file ready ok. 37 d  teacher: yes!,1,3
38725,168,student: 38 h  teacher: yes :),1,2
38726,168,student: 39 f  teacher: yes!,0,2
38727,168,student: 40 ......b  teacher: yes!,1,1
38728,168,student: 41 a  teacher: yes!,2,1
38729,168,student: 42 e  teacher: yes!,1,1
38730,168,student: 43 g  teacher: yaaaay!,1,1
38731,168,student: wow  teacher: you did it!!!,3,2
38732,168,"student: i was 100 per cent sure something's wrong  teacher: nope, you crushed it :)",3,3
38733,168,student: wow #error! i'm happy  teacher: well done! you should be!,4,2
38734,168,"student: i do really hate those tasks though <another student> can tell you how i struggled while completing it  teacher: haha, yes. my strategy when i was preparing for cpe was a lot of underlining with a pencil",3,3
38735,168,student: i need to print it then  teacher: i would underline the words that link the two paragraphs (before and after),3,2
38736,168,"student: yes! i do the same just in my head  teacher: true! you also need to know whether your exam will be paper-based or computer-based because obviously, there's no use getting used to underlining in a computer-based exam",3,3
38737,168,"student: which one is more common?  teacher: but i think a computer-based one allows you to drag-and-drop paragraphs, which can also be quite visually helpful i don't know what it's like in kyiv now! i sat the paper-based one, but it was, like 10 years ago now",3,2
38738,168,student: that would be great if they do it  teacher: it all depends on the exam centre and whether they have enough computers and which model they prefer,3,1
38739,168,"student: i see which center is the best for this type of exams? in your opinion  teacher: british council was the only one that offered cpe at the time, but grade might do it now too",3,2
38740,168,"student: now there are plenty  teacher: it shouldn't matter, the exam experience should be the same across the world, this is the job of an exam centre",3,1
38741,168,"student: from what i've managed to find bc is the optimal choice i guess  teacher: and grade or the bc, you will probably get the same speaking examiners because there are very few examiners who are qualified to do cpe (<teacher's husband> used to do it) i liked the bc, they had a nice cafe :)",2,2
38742,168,"student: i see.  teacher: the one in podil but like i say, they were the only option",2,1
38743,168,"student: oh nice. a cafe! that's a definitive pro for me  teacher: a bit of useless trivia: one of the cpe examiners in kyiv is the wife of andrei kurkov, the writer",3,3
38744,168,"student: is he a famous writer?))  teacher: i've never read him, to be honest! i keep meaning to. but i saw his books in english bookshops",3,2
38745,168,student: so he writes in english?  teacher: is he quite famous in kyiv?,2,3
38746,168,"student: never heard of him  teacher: hmm, i presume they are translations, but i might be wrong! his wife is english, so he might be bilingual",3,2
38747,168,"student: i'll look him up  teacher: this is what wiki has to say andrey yuryevich kurkov is a ukrainian novelist and an independent thinker who writes in russian. he is the author of 19 novels, including the bestselling death and the penguin, 9 books for children, and about 20 documentary, fiction and tv movie scripts. an independent thinker! :))",4,3
38748,168,student: what a biography. did his wife compose it? ))))  teacher: i wonder that :)),2,2
38749,168,"student: interesting ))  teacher: he's quite prolific it seems. amazon.uk is offering me lots of books by him, now that i've googled him :)",2,3
38750,168,student: amazon follows you  teacher: definitely!,2,1
38751,168,"student: i saw a funny tik tok video couple of days ago  teacher: oh, before we continue, i'll just mention that i'll take some time off (or more like <teacher's child> will be off starting from next week) and be back to chats from monday january 4. i do understand this is bang in the middle of the festive period for you, so do let me know whether you'd like a class on january 6 tik tok! you're way more social media savvy than me!",2,3
38752,168,"student: i saw it on ig ok sure! let's try the 6th  teacher: see, i don't even know what ig is :)",2,1
38753,168,"student: instagram  teacher: ah, ok! the gram :))",4,2
38754,168,"student: i hate tik tok actually  teacher: ok, jan 6th! it's quite new, isn't it?",0,0
38755,168,"student: yes. the audiences there ... it's just sad.  teacher: so is the idea that it's videos? like insta, but videos? why is it sad?",3,3
38756,168,"student: anyway, the video was about a wife after seeing her husband leaving his mobile phone on the table and going to the shower, takes the phone and talks to eat to it* very slowly she says buy flowers kyiv' 'buy new iphone 11 kyiv centre' 'beautiful roses kyiv; trying to train the search engines so that later they can show her husband a targeted ad  teacher: haha, oh goodness! now there's a new way to plant ideas into people's heads",3,4
38757,168,"student: smart, right? now you know how to plant a gift idea into <teacher's husband>'s head  teacher: devious! haha, i just ask :)",3,3
38758,168,student: i'll try it with <student's husband>. see if it works))  teacher: let me know!,3,2
38759,168,student: asking is always better! sure for the sake of the experiment  teacher: in case he doesn't get the hint :),3,3
38760,168,student: <student's husband> is bad at hints he's bad even when i directly ask for something particular.  teacher: :))) oh no!,2,2
38761,168,student: he just forgets what it was right away  teacher: <student's child> will have to train him up,1,3
38762,168,"student: the mind of a simultaneous interpreter i guess  teacher: oh, true, he kind of clears the cash immediately?",3,3
38763,168,student: <student's child> will persevere exactly. that's how i call it too  teacher: that's ___ i call it too,2,2
38764,168,student: what )) sorry  teacher: yes :) no worries! i know it's hard! it's still hard for me to think of hair as 'it' i have to make a conscious effort,3,3
38765,168,student: old habits die hard  teacher: definitely!,2,2
38766,168,"student: you want to say 'they'?  teacher: die hard, i wonder if <teacher's husband>'s going to make me watch it this xmas. it's a xmas movie in the uk! yep!",1,3
38767,168,"student: i know. my sis just told me yesterday that they watched it together with her boyfriend and decorated the xtree  teacher: oh, where does she live? i forgot",3,2
38768,168,"student: what movie is your xmas movie? she lives in kyiv now she used to live in london. and before that she'd lived in boston  teacher: well, the kiddie ones, like the grinch and christmas chronicles. love actually (soppy, i know!) and musicals (poor <teacher's husband>!)",4,3
38769,168,student: love actually! my all-time favourite xmas movie  teacher: snap! :)),4,2
38770,168,"student: what about home alone?  teacher: i've never watched it! weird, i know! maybe it's time",3,3
38771,168,student: maybe instead of diehard?  teacher: maybe!,2,2
38772,168,"student: the humour is pretty much on the same level  teacher: haha :))) excellent yes, die hard for me is snape crashing a xmas party",3,3
38773,168,"student: the 1 and the 2 are the only good ones ahahaha oh yes, i forgot he was in it a german guy  teacher: yes :) alan rickman and in love actually too, actually!",2,2
38774,168,"student: he's adorable  teacher: i know it's a bit weird to practise speaking in this format, but shall we have a go at a couple of speaking questions from cpe? c2 proficiency, i should say he is lovely, yes!",4,1
38775,168,student: the way he grunts -- i just love it  teacher: he grunts?? maybe i do have to rewatch die hard :)),3,3
38776,168,"student: how about when this cambridge experiment's over and you have more free time, i'll take some extra lessons in skype to practise speaking and writing? meanwhile, we can continue with the test part of the exam?  teacher: ok sure, we can do that! even though writing is actually perfect for this format, i do it with other students would you like a writing homework for the xmas holiday? (i'm so good at xmas presents!)",3,2
38777,168,"student: oh. only speaking then, right. i would!  teacher: yes, c2 writing is tough and it pays to start early! the main reason it's tough is the time limit: 1 h 30 min to write two essays",3,1
38778,168,"student: i think for me speaking and writing will be tough really? 90 minutes? it is scary  teacher: well, you're fluent, so not too tough, but at c2 level you obviously aim to impress, not just speak and write",3,2
38779,168,"student: that's the problem ))  teacher: yes, and each essay should be 280-320 words",1,1
38780,168,"student: anyway, what would you like me to write about? omg maybe passing this exam is not such a good idea after all)))))  teacher: yes, that's another thing to think about in terms of computer-based / paper-based. if you type fast, a computer-based exam could give an advantage",2,2
38781,168,"student: i think it's more or less the same speed  teacher: well, we can give it a go and practise! you didn't think you'd be good at reading and use of english, remember? there are two parts to a writing exam. you have no choice of task in part 1, but in part 2 there are a few options hold on a sec, i'll email you the paper",3,3
38782,168,"student: yes-yes. i tend to underestimate myself )) ok thank you  teacher: there goes, have a quick look please",2,2
38783,168,student: ok opened it  teacher: part 1 is a summary task. i would start with part 2 just this one time because there's a method to the summary task that we won't have time to discuss today,3,2
38784,168,student: understood so task 2 then  teacher: could you have a look at part 2? which option would you like?,3,1
38785,168,student: hard to tell all of them are terrible  teacher: i know!! :)))),2,3
38786,168,"student: 4 i guess  teacher: well, i suppose the question is, which one would be easiest to write about and work some good language in?",3,2
38787,168,student: the only one i can relate to is number 4  teacher: i would also go for 4 it was me. unless i knew lots of good words to describe a building :)),4,2
38788,168,"student: or a cartoon book )))) do i start like dear ,,,  teacher: yes, you can work in lots of emotion vocab, and stuff like 3rd conditionals (what would have happened if you hadn't decided...) and inversions! little did i know at the time that...",3,3
38789,168,"student: a nice tip! thank you!  teacher: yes, absolutely, you need a formal letter",2,1
38790,168,"student: so starting with 'dear sir' will be ok?  teacher: it's kind of a cross between a letter and an essay dear sir or madam,",3,2
38791,168,"student: ok got it i'll try i'll send it to your emal email  teacher: i have decided to take part in ... i have seen the invitation to share... in your magazine something like that, to start with",2,1
38792,168,student: thank you!  teacher: you can do it! :)),3,2
38793,168,"student: have a great holiday! i'll do my best  teacher: thank you! you too, have a lovely time with your family!",3,3
38794,168,student: thank you! bye!  teacher: i'll talk to you in the new year! (we can obviously keep in touch on messenger in the meantime) bye <student> :),4,2
38796,177,student: hi <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?,2,2
38797,177,"student: fine thank you and you?  teacher: are you at home or at work? same old, thank you. lockdown life!",2,3
38798,177,"student: at work now, i've had one more strength training today maybe yesterday my muscles will thank me )  teacher: oh cool! i usually try to avoid strength training :)",3,4
38799,177,"student: me too )  teacher: you mean tomorrow? it's good to challenge yourself though, well done you!",3,3
38800,177,"student: but i would like to have three trainings per week and there are one pilates, one yoga and one strength training every week sure, sorry! tomorrow ) why i've used yesterday )  teacher: no worries :)",3,2
38801,177,student: actually last time i'm not sure that i need to challenge myself often )  teacher: were your muscles really sore?,2,3
38802,177,"student: even more i try to be more relaxed )  teacher: ha, i see! this can be a challenge too, but it is important!",3,2
38803,177,"student: there are too many things to worry in our life that i try to be ) ohhh  teacher: oh, have you watched anything interesting in english recently? how's it going with netflix?",3,3
38804,177,"student: i try to be quite in my own one ) agree! it's a challenge for me to be relaxed )) ok it's funny  teacher: yes, well said! did you mean 'quiet'? as in 'peaceful and quiet'?",3,2
38805,177,"student: we've started watching method kominsky with <student's husband>  teacher: oh, i love the kominsky method!!!",4,3
38806,177,"student: it's his first series ) he feels beat ) is it right expression&amp;  teacher: haha, well, it's a good series to start with!",2,2
38807,177,"student: have you seen it? ) i like it it's easy and funny )  teacher: he feels defeated? like you won (or tv won) and he lost? yes, we watched both seasons. i think there are only two seasons",3,3
38808,177,"student: like he's never seen series and thought that he wouldn't and now he's watching *he's never watched yes. we've started the second season recently  teacher: hmm, i'm trying to think how he might feel is he pleased he's watching it now? the actors are just superb in it",3,3

38927,159,student: yes! sure! actually it's interesting  teacher: i was thinking about a way to express that you don't give refund and instead use the money to pay for the next class i think a good way would be 'the payment will be used as credit towards the next class',3,3

38973,83,"teacher: oh, it's the same thing, isn't it?  student: no it doesn't",2,1
38974,83,"teacher: how is it different?  student: kindergarden is place where adults leave children when they work and pre-school is place where children learn how to write, read",3,3
38975,83,"teacher: ah, i understand, thanks for that  student: you're welcome",1,1
38976,83,"teacher: here in the uk, it's a pre-school or a nursery. i think the only difference is that pre-schools are state-owned and nurseries are private. quick grammar quiz, <student>  student: ok",2,2
38977,83,"teacher: 1. if schools don't re-open in september, i ____ ____ could you finish the sentence, please?  student: i'll stay at home",3,3
38978,83,"teacher: great! what about if i ____ in the usa now, i ____ eat cheeseburgers for breakfast! silly example, i know, just for the grammar  student: have been/ will",3,2
38979,83,"teacher: how about 'if i were in the usa now, i would eat...'? does it sound familiar? it's ok if it doesn't!  student: i think it's similar",3,3
38980,83,"teacher: it's a bit different, but we can look into this next time. it's called second conditionals, for things that are not true at the moment you've probably heard about it  student: i thought that it's third conditional oh no",3,3
38981,83,"teacher: no worries, we'll play with this grammar next time!  student: can you remind please?",2,2
38982,83,"teacher: we are almost out of time now, i will next time, ok?  student: oh ok",1,1

38993,54,"teacher: oh yes ok great - can you send it to me now?  student: oh...i understand, it is my mistakes. yes",2,2
38994,54,teacher: ok  student: i was hanging out at the city centre in cambridge when i bought a second-hand book. .i went to national gallery when i was trialing to london. i majored in economics when i was studying in japan. students studied advanced mathematics when they were doing researches on economics. .i was walking back home when i saw a ufo on the sky. i was reading pomes when i trended to write down some beautiful sentences.,3,4
38995,54,teacher: ok thanks <student> - yes that's good. you've definitely got the idea of the past simple/continuous relationship hold on - a couple of quick questions ....  student: okey,3,1
38996,54,"teacher: ok so graet grammar overall - just a couple of things to think about that i've marked with a '?'...any ideas on changes you need to make? <student> : i was hanging out at the city centre in cambridge when i bought a second-hand book. <student> : .i went to ____ ??national gallery when i was trialing (??)to london. <student> : i majored in economics when i was studying in japan. <student> : students studied advanced mathematics when they were doing researches (??) on economics. <student> : .i was walking back home when i saw a ufo on(??) the sky. <student> : i was reading pomes when i trended (??) to write down some beautiful sentences. ok? can you see the bits i'm asking about?  student: the worng past simple of words, right?",3,2
38997,54,teacher: um..hold on a sec... add a word in the gap and the second verb is not understandable....: i went to ____ ??national gallery when i was trialing (??)to london.  student: the,2,1
38998,54,"teacher: yes good!.....  student: because national gallery is specific,right?",3,3
38999,54,"teacher: well yes that's one way of looking at it - but this rule isn't always true i'm afraid! hold on <student> - let's have a think about that now ok?  student: ok,,thanks",3,2
39000,54,"teacher: we can caome back to your sentences later maybe - the important thing is that you have understood the past simple/continuous rule - well done  student: yes, thanks a lot",3,1
39001,54,teacher: but the use of articles (the/a) is a grammar point that you should improve too - it will help your score...here we go....hold on!  student: ok,2,0
39002,54,teacher: so <student> can you give me sentence from the following keywords please?! : thames/london ? (you know what this is right?) for example is i gave you these keywords : heathrow/london you could say: heathrow is an airport in london. ... ok? so..thames/london...give me a sentence if oyu can  student: thames is a river in london. .,3,2
39003,54,teacher: ok thanks - i'll give you one back! 'the yangtze is the longest river in china. can you add a word in your example??' just one little word!  student: thames is a famous river in london.,3,3
39004,54,teacher: hold on...my example was confusing i;m sorry - look at this one: 'the yangtze river is in china.' can you add a diffrent word! sorry go ahead: for example: '_______ river thames is in london.' ?  student: the yangtze river is the longest in china.,3,2
39005,54,teacher: ok cool ...so when we write/say the names of rivers we need/do not need 'the'?!  student: the famous river thames is in london we need i guess,3,3
39006,54,"teacher: ok great so we always need to say 'the' with rivers ok?  student: yes, i see",3,1
39007,54,teacher: one more <student>: sahara/africa ...give me a sentence!  student: the sahara is in africa.,4,3
39008,54,teacher: yes good - so we use 'the' with _____ and ______?  student: the sahara is biggest in africa. with river and desert or with place and name.,3,2
39009,54,teacher: well hold on - a lot of the time yes but not always hold on....yes good with rivers and deserts...ok one more: pacific/world/biggest ...go for it!  student: the pacific is the biggest ocean in the word. so..with names and places?,3,3
39010,54,teacher: yes perfect wel ldone ...so we need 'the' with rivers/deserts/oceans!  student: or something is specific,3,2
39011,54,"teacher: ok so....remember my heathrow example? was there an article there?  student: okey,i understand no.. the heathrow is an airport in london.",3,3
39012,54,"teacher: no! but heathrow is a specific place of course - so it depends on the place i'm afraid. so <student> your example there ('the heathrow....') is wrong... look at these: stansted is an airport just outside london./cambridge university is very famous./king's cross is a famous station in london. so...we do not use 'the' when we talk about 3 types of places (for example) : __________, __________ and ________??  student: okey..i am confuse about it. airport/university/station",3,2
39013,54,"teacher: so yes we use the 'the' for rivers/deserts/oceans (for example) but we do not use 'the' for example when we talk about .....yes, i see your answer! correct - airports, universities/stations you just have to remember these rules i;m afraid!  student: ok, i got it - thanks",2,2
39014,54,teacher: ok <student> quick practice - so you might talk/write about these places in ielts - give me an example of something you might say about each one of these 6 categories (rivers/deserts/oceans/stations/airports/universities) i mean with a specific example ok? with a name!  student: ok.. i will try,3,3
39015,54,"teacher: sorry <student> i'll wait for your example but here's a quick idea to help you - pollution is increasing in many rivers and oceans around hte world. for example, the yangtze river in china is so polluted that there are no fish left' i'm sorry if that's not true! i should have chosen a different river!  student: yes, i can understand",4,2
39016,54,"teacher: ok.... try one before we have a break if you can....  student: okey see you sorry ,, i am typing ...",3,1
39017,54,"teacher: no problem ....i'll wait!  student: application of students is increasing in many universities in the uk, for example, cambridge university is also the most poplar university around the world that at least 100 thousands proposer a year. popular",3,3
39018,54,teacher: ok thanks <student> - so you've got a grammatically correct example without 'the' wrong!! you will get a better mark than them! lots of other...i mean see you after the break...we'll do some essay intros ok?  student: thank a lot,3,1
39019,54,teacher: ok  student: yes see you,0,0

39027,110,teacher: exactly it's getting worse again in the uk. there are more cases of covid and the number is rising  student: in ukraine we have the same situation unfortunately,2,1
39028,110,"teacher: oh really? what's it like? are shops / restaurants / schools open?  student: yes, everything and everybody work",3,2
39029,110,"teacher: what's the government planning to do about it all? here, boris addressed the nation last night again  student: i think it's because the government can't do lockdown one more time because of econimical reasons",3,3
39030,110,"teacher: yes, exactly the same situation here  student: i red some post on instagram about the uk",2,2

39036,110,"teacher: oh bless, my heart bleeds  student: because he wants to work and earn money",2,2
39037,110,"teacher: do you know the expression 'my heart bleeds for someone'?  student: oh bless, my heart bleeds - sorry, i don't know this frase what does it mean? )",3,3
39038,110,"teacher: if you say 'my heart bleeds' it means you are sorry for someone (your heart bleeds for them), but it's mostly used sarcastically. i definitely used it sarcastically as i'm not really feeling sorry for him!  student: ah! it's clear now, thank you )",3,2
39039,110,"teacher: i'm going to be throwing in some words and phrases that might be interesting to you, so yes, just ask questions, well done :)  student: actually, i have a question now about this conversation )",4,3
39040,110,"teacher: yes, of course!  student: maybe you know.will be this conversation saved after its finishing? can i check it later for some words or expressions? or should i notice them now? and i have one more )",3,4
39041,110,"teacher: yes, the text is saved but you won't have access to it, sorry about that! i'll be making a list of new words every time, so don't worry, we'll go back to them. you can always copy and paste things or write them down! yes, sure  student: actually it's not a question. more like my advise for people who made this software",3,3
39042,110,"teacher: are you on your phone or laptop, by the way? yes, please!  student: it would be more convenient to have option like 'to answer a question' i don't know exactly how to cal it better",3,2
39043,110,"teacher: oh, i see, like a reply button? yes, i'm with you!  student: oh, sure! reply sorry, i forgot the word ))",3,3
39044,110,"teacher: yes, this is useful feedback, thank you! and it would also be useful to be able to see when the other person is typing  student: agree! i'm on my laptop now",3,2
39045,110,teacher: i think they kept this chatroom deliberately very basic. it's not like messenger but it serves the purpose!  student: deliberately? ),3,1
39046,110,"teacher: when you do something deliberately, you do it and you know you want to do it! an antonym of accidentally  student: thank you",3,2
39047,110,"teacher: so the people who created this chatroom wanted it to be very basic, and that's what it is!  student: i see! and <teacher> i'm very very sorry",3,1
39048,110,"teacher: for example, i was a bit hurt by what my friend said, but i don't think she said it deliberately to upset me yes, go on!  student: i know that yesterday was a big day for you )",3,2
39049,110,"teacher: ah yes, thank you! :)  student: it was <teacher's child>'s birthday sorry i missed it!",2,3

39051,110,"teacher: thank you! it was really weird that he was at school all day. we used to always be able to take a day off for his birthday (and every birthday in the family), but we don't have this freedom anymore!  student: no party yesterday??",3,3
39052,110,"teacher: i know! he's lucky because he's one of the oldest kids in his class. in the uk, children start school in september after their 4th birthday, and there are some kids with august birthdays in his class. they are still babies, 11 months younger than <teacher's child>! we wanted to take him out to eat at his favourite cafe, but he was so tired he wanted to go home! so we ended up ordering a pizza.  student: pizza is always a good idea ) <student's child> likes it so much",4,3
39053,110,"teacher: well, he did play with his friend next door on saturday, and <teacher's husband>'s parents are coming this weekend. we couldn't have a party this year because you can't have more than 6 people together socializing  student: it seems like ideal birthday for five years boy",2,2
39054,110,"teacher: we gave him a game table where you can play table football, air hockey, ping pong and snooker so we ended up playing that, it was great fun! that's it, i don't miss throwing a big party. i find it a bit stressful!  student: agree",3,1
39055,110,teacher: and by 'a bit' i mean 'very' :)  student: haha,3,1
39056,110,teacher: i did make a cake! a black forest gateau do you this one?  student: no!,3,1
39057,110,"teacher: sorry, it's a black forest gateau, i should have capitalized it  student: the name is very interesting",3,2
39058,110,teacher: schwarzwalden cake the chocolate one with cherries and cream i'm sure you know it!  student: hm i have to google ),3,1
39059,110,teacher: my mum always used to make a version of this cake for me!  student: i've checked ) i know it ),2,2
39060,110,teacher: yes sure :)  student: yummy )),2,1
39061,110,"teacher: but i prefer it with ukrainian sour cherries, not the sweet cherries that we have here  student: did you make it yourself?",3,3
39062,110,"teacher: you love baking, don't you? i did! and it worked!  student: it's difficult to make it?",3,3
39063,110,"teacher: mmm, it takes a bit of time but i wouldn't say it's difficult time-consuming  student: don't you have 'usual'cherries there?",2,2
39064,110,"teacher: well, that's the trouble. 'usual' cherries in this country are sweet! sour cherries are called morello cherries and are quite hard to get. sometimes you can buy them frozen from a supermarket but! i'm planting a morello cherry tree in my garden this spring! so i'll have a good supply in a few years  student: you can grow them in your garden )",3,3
39065,110,teacher: i have to!  student: haha! i knew ),2,2
39066,110,"teacher: poor me :) anyway, i know you love baking, tell me about it, please!  student: i love baking but not time-consuming things )) i like ti make something fast and have a good result )",3,3
39067,110,"teacher: oh, i completely agree! i just made a special effort for <teacher's child>'s birthday! you bake a lot of bread, don't you?  student: like 'my' baguette ) jus baguette ) i baked one sweet bread it's german thing",3,2
39068,110,teacher: interesting!  student: let me think unfortunatelly i don't remember the name,2,1
39069,110,teacher: i have no idea either!  student: they bake it for easter,1,2
39070,110,"teacher: ah, an easter bread! i want to make ukrainian easter cakes this easter oh, you know what i really want to learn to bake? donetska zdoba  student: i think it's too difficult for me )",3,3
39071,110,teacher: i really miss those buns!  student: donetska zdoba ? i don't know! is it a cake?,3,3
39072,110,teacher: you do! you have them in every bakery! donetskaya sdoba? the little ukrainian buns  student: i've google it,4,2
39073,110,"teacher: do you know what i mean?  student: it's funny, but i don't know these buns )))",2,3
39074,110,teacher: no way!! they are the absolute best! when fresh and with a bit of butter  student: actually now i prefer not to buy bread in the supermarket,4,2
39075,110,teacher: do you just make your own?  student: i try to make it myself or just don't eat the bread ),2,3
39076,110,teacher: have you got a breadmaker or do you bake it in the oven?  student: i have to send you a recepi of buns which i have from my mum in the oven,3,4
39077,110,"teacher: yes, please, send me a recipe!  student: but we use for them sour cream",3,3
39078,110,"teacher: i've prepared lots of material related to food, but i think it'll have to wait until friday  student: i'm not sure if you have it there",3,2
39079,110,teacher: i can get sour cream here. it's not the same but close enough  student: oh! super! so you can try the recipe! it's easy and tasty!,3,3
39080,110,teacher: yes please! a couple of things from today. 'this man ___ ____ in london for about 10 years (live)'  student: and my mom made 'sayka' buns is living?,3,2
39081,110,"teacher: oh, i know, heart-shaped? this man has lived in london... no worries, i'm just noting some things we can look into later  student: sure, sorry not heart-shaped, but you can do them like that",3,3
39082,110,"teacher: no, not sorry, you've done really well with all the chatting in english! i just need to see what could be useful for you and what material i should prepare  student: thank you )",3,2
39083,110,"teacher: i've baked my own sourdough bread, which was a very popular thing in the lockdown in the uk do you know sourdough?  student: no! i have to try ) it's difficult to make?",3,3
39084,110,"teacher: it's the bread you make without shop-bought yeast. you ferment flour and water for a while until it produces it's own yeast it's not difficult but it takes a few days to make that sourdough starter! but once you have it, you can make bread, waffles, pancakes, focaccia - so many things  student: i see! actually this sort of bread is better than with shop-bought yeast i think",4,2
39085,110,"teacher: yes, i'll give you a recipe if you'd like.  student: i really need it now ) thank you!",3,3
39086,110,"teacher: oh no, time to go! that went fast! thank you for today! some of the new words were 'deliberately', 'time-consuming' (you used it very well, so maybe it wasn't new) and 'my heart bleeds' for expressing sarcasm. we'll return to them another day!  student: thank you very much!",3,2
39087,110,"teacher: and i'll see you here on friday at the same time for more food talk, right?  student: see you soon!",3,1
39088,110,"teacher: see you, take care!  student: thank you! see you! take care too",2,1
39089,110,"teacher: :) you can just close the programme, everything is saved automatically  student: ok, thanks!",3,2
39091,134,student: hello!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?,3,2
39092,134,"student: great, thank you! how about you?  teacher: all good, thanks. it's been unseasonally warm here",2,3
39093,134,"student: really? here it is quite cold...  teacher: oh interesting! maybe our warmth will soon reach you guys, or maybe vice versa, we'll get your cold weather",3,4
39094,134,"student: we shall see...i hope it will get a bit warmer, it really went from summer to winter weather in a matter of days  teacher: how's the lockdown going for you? are there any aspects you're enjoying or is a survival for you, with two young kids and working from home? i wonder if the climate in austria is less affected by the ocean, with it being landlocked, so you're getting more of a contrast of seasons",4,2
39095,134,"student: well...currently it is mostly a curfew, at least the children go to the childminer in the morning. so, currently i am doing fine...i hope they'll let the childminer work, though, because the few hours of silence during the morning make a big difference.  teacher: ah, i see! that's good. it's a childminder. someone who minds other people's children, as in looks after them",3,1
39096,134,"student: well...yes, austria has a bit more of a continental climate...but graz is relatively close to slovinia and the sea, so it shoud have the best weather.  teacher: a few hours of quiet, yes",1,0
39097,134,"student: at least, this is what they told me. oh! i must have read it wrong the first time: i was wondering about what 'miner' and 'keeping children' had in common... thank you for catching it :) childminder it is, then!  teacher: you sound a bit disappointed in the weather :) i bet it's quite an adjustment for you. it still is for me! yes, no miners! :)",3,3
39098,134,"student: haha...well, actually my hometown is quite a rainy place...but in trieste i got used to a very nice weather. how was the week of vacation? i guess the warm weather was a plus for you!  teacher: it rained for most of the week (of course!) but we had a lovely relaxing time, thank you the warm weather has only just started, really did you move to graz for your job / research then?",3,2
39099,134,"student: oh...well, then who knows how long it will last... yes, i moved here for my job: it is a very good position...and it is relatively close to my home region: without the corona it takes less about three hours by car  teacher: sure. could you fill in the gap: if it wasn't __ corona, it would take less than 3 hours",2,2
39100,134,"student: for i think...  teacher: yes, cool. just checking :) mind you, every time the weather is particularly warm, which i love, there is always a thought at the back of my mind, is it actually the result of climate change and not something to be particularly happy about?",3,3
39101,134,"student: i agree with you on that one. climate is more concerned on the weather over time...so a single day of warm could just be okay...  teacher: yes, but when there is a pattern, there is something to worry about",3,2
39102,134,"student: the problem is that it happens so often and that the temperature is so high. indeed...climate change, unfortunately, is a complex problem: everyone should mint it. *mind it...  teacher: yes, well, hopefully, it's not too late to act on this one!",3,3
39103,134,student: i hope it too!  teacher: it hope __ too,1,1
39104,134,student: that  teacher: so,1,0
39105,134,"student: okay...i agree that 'i hope so too' sounds better, but i wouldn't know why. is it just how the verb 'hope' works?  teacher: just thinking how to explain it best",4,2
39106,134,"student: (for this particular case)  teacher: one second hope doesn't take a direct object which makes it an 'intransitive' verb i hope for the best we need 'for' here alternatively, we need a clause i hope that we will be able to avert climate change",3,3
39107,134,"student: i see! wow, this is definitely an italian-related mistake, since in italian 'to hope' is transitive. i hope that i learn how to use the verb to hope  teacher: aha, that will be it then, it's language 1 interference for you exactly! and of course, it can be a noun as you know",3,4
39108,134,"student: i hope to learn this.' would also be incorrect, right? i mean, 'to learn' would be the direct object in that case  teacher: oh yes, i hope to do something - perfectly fine no, a direct object would be a noun or something that can function as a noun read a book book - direct object",4,3
39109,134,"student: okay...i don't know why i included anything answering to 'what?/who?' under the definition of direct noun.  teacher: remember we were talking about the british vs. us use of write? in british english, i write a letter to my teacher. a letter indirect object",2,2
39110,134,"student: yes, i remember vaguely: in the us people omit the 'to', but i can't exactly remember in which case.  teacher: you know what, you're actually right. 'to learn' is an infinitive object now that i think about it in us english, you can say, i'll write you a letter. or she hasn't written me in uk english: she hasn't written to me",4,3
39111,134,student: i'll write to you a letter.  teacher: i'll write a letter to you direct object before the indirect one :),3,2
39112,134,"student: indeed...ordering problem there. about the 'i hope to learn'...so would it be correct to use hope + infinitive object?  teacher: yes, of course hope to verb; hope for noun; hope that clause",4,3
39113,134,"student: okay, i'll write that down. thank you!  teacher: hope for the best (not a noun, but a very common expression)",3,2
39114,134,"student: i see, i would add that 'hope for the best' is a common expression given the current times.  teacher: ok, shall we have another look at your writing? i've got one last remark for the piece about elon musk",3,3
39115,134,"student: yes, please!  teacher: this is about a parallel structure again it definitely is a must-read for anyone interested into this incredible person or spacex/tesla fan first of all, interested in sorry, interested in but more importantly, the parallel structure doesn't work here it's a must-read for anyone interested in this person",2,2
39116,134,student: interested into' okay...i think i mixed it up with expressions such as 'i'm into math'  teacher: first part is fine but it's a must-read for anyone spacex / tesla fan wouldn't work grammatically and we need both parts to work,2,2
39117,134,"student: hmmm... it's a must-read for every spacex / tesla fan that is how i would correct that part...but then, would the parallel structure work? i guess not...  teacher: you can still make it work for both parts it's a must-read for anyone __ ___ interested in... or space x / tesla fan",3,3
39118,134,student: who is  teacher: yes!! correct do you see how it would make both parts agree grammatically?,1,2
39119,134,"student: yes, it is apparent once we split the sentence into two parts...  teacher: last but not least",1,1
39120,134,student: anyone who is insterested in... anyone who is (a) tesla fan i guess that a is missing?  teacher: correct! i was just typing about that :) you definitely need an 'a',3,3
39121,134,"student: lesson learned: from now on i will try to split parallel structures and check them separately. otherwise i find it difficult to find this sort of problems.  teacher: ok! i'm sure you will soon develop a feel for that ok, the next bit presents a similar challenge. not a parallel structure, but also a grammatical agreement problem i found this book interesting, though being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to read/follow and some concept are, i believe, oversimplified. being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to follow...",3,2
39122,134,"student: being packed with ideas makes it sometimes hard to follow. would that be better? even though i don't really like the expression 'being packed with ideas'  teacher: very good correction! you've made 'being packed with ideas' the subject otherwise, being packed with ideas doesn't agree with 'it' because you mean 'the book', not 'it' from the clause 'it makes it hard to read' how would you correct this sentence? 'having lost my glasses, it was hard for me to read'",4,3
39123,134,student: mmm...i am thinking  teacher: let me know if you don't see the problem with it :),3,2
39124,134,"student: changing the second part to 'made it hard for me to read' is an option, probably... the 'it' is not referring to 'having lost my glasses' (which is the subject)  teacher: yes, definitely",2,3
39125,134,"student: but i can't think of what would be the correct word instead of 'it'  teacher: but if you wanted to keep 'having lost my glasses', it would be something like 'having lost my glasses, i was struggling to read' because i lost my glasses, not 'it' you need the same subject in them",3,4
39126,134,"student: i see...so there was not way to simply 'correct' the word 'it'.  teacher: no, you'd need to re-structure it it's a very common higher-level learner mistake",3,3
39127,134,"student: i see...well, it looks rather difficult to find  teacher: i do agree with actually about the fact that 'being packed with ideas' is not the best choice of phrase *with you i'll have a quick look to see if i can find an exercise for you",3,2
39128,134,"student: great, thank you!  teacher: i might prepare it for the next time if you don't mind what would you suggest instead of 'packed with ideas'?",3,3
39129,134,"student: mmm...good question...i guess 'full of ideas' would sound better. but i don't think it would be the best option.  teacher: hmm, 'full of ideas' sounds more like praise, doesn't it? the book can be hard to follow due to a plethora of ideas",3,4
39130,134,"student: yes...  teacher: or 'an abundance of ideas' just as an example also, we could streamline the sentence a bit",3,2
39131,134,"student: the abundance of ideas made the book difficult to follow.  teacher: i found this book interesting, though occasionally hard to follow due to an abundance of ideas sorry, my internet connection is a bit wobbly, resulting in double turns",2,1
39132,134,"student: don't worry, my connection is also wobbly... i found this book interesting, though the abundance of ideas made it at times hard to follow.'  teacher: ok, we will continue our quest for better ways to write in english next time if it's ok with you! pretty much an endless process :) i like it, yes!! very concise, too",3,2
39133,134,"student: i agree, an endless process. thank you for your time and help!  teacher: it's my pleasure!",4,1
39134,134,"student: next week, same time, same place?  teacher: yes, barring any disasters :) speak to you then!",4,3
39136,142,student: hi  teacher: hi <student> ! how are you?,3,2
39137,142,"student: i am fine and you?  teacher: fine, thank you! did you meet the puppy on friday? has it got a name yet?",3,3
39138,142,student: yes i did his name is <dog's name> it is azerbaijanian name i think  teacher: tjat sorry! that's a nice name! was he super cute?,3,2
39139,142,"student: yes he was biting my leg a lot )  teacher: i heard there's now a 'weekend lockdown' in force in kyiv, is that right?",2,1
39140,142,"student: yes  teacher: ah, puppies do that, don't they :)",3,3
39141,142,student: i don't really know anything about that  teacher: is it not affecting your life very much?,3,2
39142,142,"student: about lockdown no on this weekend no  teacher: fair enough! are your extra classes still open? the acting, the english, the coding and logic?",3,3
39143,142,"student: we had logic online this time they rent university , and it was closed so we had online because of that  teacher: oh, they are renting a classroom at a university?",2,2
39144,142,"student: ooops yes a lot of classrooms  teacher: no worries, this chatroom does that when there's a glitch with the internet",2,1
39145,142,student: it is snowww  teacher: cool! are you still enjoying acting?,3,3
39146,142,student: it is snowing right now!!!  teacher: oh really??????,2,2

39148,142,student: hehe that's because of rain  teacher: is it sub zero? it is going to set?,1,2
39149,142,"student: firstly it was rain but now it is snowing  teacher: aha, but then the situation changed, so you need ____, not firstly :)",1,3
39150,142,student: so it is not like really good snow mmm  teacher: can you remember what we use if the situation changes? __ ___ at first!,3,2
39151,142,"student: oh  teacher: could you make a full sentence, please, about the rain and the snow",2,2
39152,142,"student: at first it was raining ,but now it is snowing  teacher: perfect :) it must look magical!",4,3
39153,142,"student: a bit for you yes) for me it is a bit usual thing for november  teacher: oh yes, i really hope we'll get at least a day of snow this winter i know :)",3,2
39154,142,"student: my dad isn't really happy about that  teacher: even though we're much further north than kyiv! no, why not?",3,1
39155,142,student: he washed his car today it is not clean anymore)  teacher: it must be disappointing for him!,3,2
39156,142,"student: yes  teacher: speaking of magic, shall we do a bit of hp stuff today?",4,4
39157,142,"student: i don't mind)  teacher: good! so, as you know, there are 4 houses in hogwarts",3,3
39158,142,student: yes  teacher: and how do students get into those houses?,3,4
39159,142,"student: magic hat  teacher: yes, it's called the sorting hat because it sorts students into houses what kind of students got sorted into gryffindor?",4,4
39160,142,student: brave  teacher: yes! do you know of any other ways to say 'brave' in english?,4,3
39161,142,student: um i forgot (  teacher: there's also 'courageous' kre.ds,2,2
39162,142,student: yes  teacher: courageous noun,1,1
39163,142,"student: i know it  teacher: for example, it takes a lot of courage to stand up to a person in power ok, what's the noun for 'brave' then? brave noun",3,3
39164,142,student: bravery  teacher: well done! and what's the opposite of courage and bravery?,3,4
39165,142,student: i know it from ih  teacher: good :),2,1
39166,142,student: bn oy hmmmm  teacher: the behaviour of someone who is not brave and tries to avoid danger cowardice ka..ds,1,1
39167,142,student: i know fear  teacher: also a noun,1,2
39168,142,"student: i didn't know iy  teacher: yes, fear is an emotion we feel. but when we feel fear, we can be brave and still do something that frightens us or we can be 'cowardly' and not do it cowardly = adjective obviously, some people call it 'cautious' :) and a person who is not brave, is a coward no one likes being called a coward :)",3,3
39169,142,student: yeaaah  teacher: is there anyone in the hp stories that you would call a coward?,3,2
39170,142,"student: makes sense tail  teacher: oh, wormtail? absolutely, i agree!",2,3

39173,142,"student: yeah  teacher: also, if you're brave enough to do something, we can say that you 'dare' do it for example, nobody likes how this teacher talks to the class, but nobody dares stand up to her or 'i wanted to know how old he was but i didn't dare ask' and the adjective is 'daring' brave / courageous / daring very close meaning ok, that's for gryffindor qualities then what about ravenclaw? what are students like there?",3,4
39174,142,student: smart  teacher: ok! any synonyms to smart?,3,2
39175,142,"student: clever  teacher: yes, and... i..........",1,1

39177,142,"student: i was typing  teacher: well done :) ok, what about slytherin?",3,3
39178,142,"student: they are also clever, but not like ravenclaw i forgot the words:(  teacher: ok, they are amitious, right?",3,3

39181,142,student: i am on slytherin  teacher: what do you mean? (i'm going to ask you what you mean to get longer sentences out of you :)),3,3
39182,142,"student: slytherin is my favorite house, so i think sorting hat should sort me there) (also i like draco , but it doesn't matter)  teacher: ah, good sentence, thank you! and very interesting! i'll give you some more words, and you tell me why :) cunning = adjective; clever at getting what you want, sometimes by tricking people like a cunning fox from fairy tales",4,4
39183,142,student: yes i wanted to say it  teacher: yes! so why would you like to be in slytherin?,4,3

39186,142,"student: friendly  teacher: yes, friendly and kind!",2,2
39187,142,"student: and i like slytherin because everyone think people tgere are a bit scary  teacher: an adjective that often describes hufflepuff students is 'humble' hm.bl which means not proud or arrogant or believing you're too important he's very humble about his success means he doesn't talk about it very much, for example not many people have this lovely quality :) ok, so why is slytherin your favourite house?",3,3
39188,142,"student: i've just type it  teacher: oh sorry, i missed that! so everyone is a bit afraid of slytherin people, and you feel it puts them in a powerful position?",4,2
39189,142,student: yes  teacher: ok)),1,1

39193,142,"student: i am very sprry to him  teacher: that's an interesting idea! ah, you're sorry for him but yes, he was conflicted, right? he didn't believe everything his family did was a good thing but he thought he had to be loyal to them ok, i've got a sorting quiz for you! i'm sure you've done them before, but i hope it'll be fun can you open this link?",3,3

39199,142,"student: it is easy to understand what to answer to be at slytherin  teacher: but i'm a hufflepuff according to this quiz yes, it's pretty transparent still fun",3,2
39200,142,"student: i think you are on hufflepuff too)  teacher: and, if we were sorted by the real sorting hat, we'd have a chance to influence its decision why am i a hufflepuff? *in hufflepuff",3,3
39201,142,"student: you are really kind  teacher: aww, thank you! and the patron of hufflepuff is helga, a bit like me",3,2
39202,142,"student: yes  teacher: helga is an old form of <teacher's name>, i mean",2,1
39203,142,"student: how can we influence ?  teacher: well, you know how the sorting hat wanted to put harry in slytherin? but he wanted to be in gryffindor, and the hat listened to him",3,3

39271,166,student: there is going to have a fast train in my howntown in about two years.  teacher: nearly. there is going to be a fast train... what do you think will change for people in your hometown when there is a fast train?,3,4
39272,166,student: ok. i thought i was wrong. it will be convenient to travel to beijing which will spend about 40 mins.  teacher: nice!,1,2
39273,166,"student: but the price of the houses in my hometown will be higher.  teacher: so people could live in your hometown and commute to work in beijing! ah, yes, this is always the consequence of better transport connection!",3,4
39274,166,"student: beijing is so big, and most conpanies are in the centre of it.  teacher: so the commute will actually take longer than 40 minutes?",3,3
39275,166,"student: so the commute will depends which area of your company located. the commute time will depend on the position of your company.  teacher: yes, it makes sense! the verb we use here is 'take'. something takes 40 minutes the train takes two hours. the commute takes forty minutes doing this work will take me two weeks it sometimes takes an author years to write a novel how long does it take you to get to work?",3,4
39276,166,"student: ok. it takes me 20 minutes to get to work.  teacher: ok, great! ok, you did another excellent job with your homework! hi david, it sounds great that your friends are going to have a holiday in my city. as you know, beijing is the capital of china, so its an excellent choice for a holiday. there are a lot of places where they may want to visit, let me introduce some of them. if they want to experience the culture of china, they should go to somewhere like the palace museum and nanluoguxiang where they can see the chinese historical royal buildings and eat the classic chinese food. also they can visit the great wall which is the symbol of chinese history. and in the great wall, they can see the beatiful scenery of beijing. by the way, because beijing is one of the biggest cities in china, during the holiday, i think they can travel by subway. in beijing subway is so convinient that they can travel to almost all places they want. at last, hope they would have a great time in beijing, if they have any problem, they can connect with me. thanks, <student> this is a really good informal letter!",4,2
39277,166,"student: thanks.  teacher: there are just a couple of problems with prepositions, one moment",3,2
39278,166,"student: ok.  teacher: i think 'classic chinese food' is a good choice, because it can be a bit confusing with snacks, as we discovered last time!",3,3
39279,166,"student: yes. i think so.  teacher: and ___ the great wall, they can see the beautiful scenery of beijing i would say, from the great wall they have to climb to the wall, and then see it from the wall",3,2
39280,166,"student: ok.  teacher: they should go to somewhere like the palace museum and nanluoguxiang they should go somewhere, without 'to'",3,1
39281,166,"student: ok.  teacher: if you use the name of a place, you need 'to'. they should go to the palace museum but 'somewhere' swallows 'to'",3,2
39282,166,"student: ok.  teacher: there is a wrong spelling of 'convenient', but you spelled it correctly earlier on in the chat :) 'convenient' but great writing overall, and you answered all the questions in the task. yay! i've got a b2 task for you to practise today. a multiple choice one. i'm going to copy the text here, and then i'm going to give you options for every question",3,3
39283,166,"student: ok. thanks a lot.  teacher: it's called 'the netherlands'. what is the word for a nationality, someone who comes from the netherlands. do you remember?",4,2
39284,166,"student: sorry, i cant remember clearly.  teacher: no worries. dutch. someone who comes from this country is dutch. also, dutch food etc. it's a bit unusual, because the words are so different anyway, have a quick look through the text, and i'll send you the options for question 1 welcome to the netherlands, a tiny country that only extends, at its broadest, 312 km north to south, and 264 km east to west - (1) ... the land area increases slightly each year as a (2) ... of continuous land reclamation and drainage. with a lot of heart and much to offer, 'holland,' as it is (3) ... known to most of us abroad - a name stemming (4) ... its once most prominent provinces - has more going on per kilometre than most countries, and more english-speaking natives. you'll be impressed by its (5) ... cities and charmed by its countryside and villages, full of contrasts. from the exciting variety (6) ... offer, you could choose a romantic canal boat tour in amsterdam, a royal tour by coach in the hague, or a hydrofoil tour around the biggest harbour in the world - rotterdam. in season you could visit the dazzling bulb fields, enjoy a full day on a boat, or take a bike tour through the pancake-flat countryside spiced with windmills. the possibilities are countless and the nationwide tourist office, which is on hand to give you information and (7) ... reservations. you'll have (8) ... language problems here, as the dutch are true linguists and english is spoken here almost universally. 1. a) so b) despite c) in spite of d) although",3,3
39285,166,"student: 1 b?  teacher: no, what would be your second choice?",2,1
39286,166,"student: d  teacher: yes, absolutely! although the country is this big, although we can't say exactly because the area increases each year despite / in spite of only work with a noun despite the fact that... / in spite of the fact that...",3,3
39287,166,"student: ok. i thought b,c,d were all right. now i know the difference of them.  teacher: i see! you were right in that you need to contrast the two pars of the sentences 2. a) whole b) consequently c) rule d) result",3,2
39288,166,student: d  teacher: correct! 3. a) regularly b) occasionally c) commonly d) unusually,3,1
39289,166,student: c  teacher: correct! commonly known is an expression 4. a) in b) from c) on d) of,3,2
39290,166,student: b  teacher: correct! stem from 5. a) historic b) historical c) historically d) historian,3,2
39291,166,student: a  teacher: yes! well done 6. a) at b) in c) on d) for,3,2
39292,166,"student: dont know, guess b?  teacher: the expression is 'on offer' something can be 'on offer' in a shop, for example 7. a) sit b) catch c) do d) make",3,3
39293,166,"student: d  teacher: yes, correct! make a reservation = book we can book a table at a restaurant / make a reservation at a restaurant ok, one last!",3,3
39294,166,student: ok.  teacher: 8. a) few b) a few c) little d) a little,2,2
39295,166,"student: a  teacher: yes, well done! what's the difference between 'few' and 'a few' here?",3,3
39296,166,"student: because english is well used in the place, there is no problems ...  teacher: exactly! 'few' means not many here but 'a few' means 'some'",3,2
39297,166,"student: ok.  teacher: for example, 'i have few friends' means i don't have enough friends",3,1
39298,166,"student: so a few &gt;= a little ?  teacher: but 'i have a few friends' means i have some friends, there's a positive meaning there is a difference between 'few' and 'little'!",3,2
39299,166,student: ok.  teacher: but it's about whether the noun is countable or uncountable i have a few friends and a little money friends uncountable noun,2,1
39300,166,"student: a few != some?  teacher: yes, correct!",2,2
39301,166,"student: ok.  teacher: i have some friends and some money :) 'some' works for both countable and uncountable can you fill in the gaps, please? i have a ___ books. i like a ___ milk in my tea. i feel a ___ upset. it only costs a ___ pounds. few / little",3,3
39302,166,"student: few,little,little,few  teacher: yes, absolutely correct! as you can see, 'upset' is an adjective, not a noun but we use 'little' here too",3,3
39303,166,"student: yes.  teacher: ok, great",2,1
39304,166,"student: can you tell me the difference between 'historic' and 'historical'?  teacher: one of my friends is dutch, and he hates it when people call his country 'holland'. he always corrects people that it's 'the netherlands' :) very good question, one second! historic = important in history it was a historic day in the history of my country (because something really important happened) a historic vote historic election historical = connected with a study of history a historical document (we learn a lot of history from it) a historical novel (a novel about history)",4,4
39305,166,"student: so historic means important in history, historical just means history?  teacher: yes, historical is about history as a study of the past let me think of more examples",3,2
39306,166,"student: ok.  teacher: if we say a city is historic, a lot of important things happened there cambridge is a historic city, the home of the famous university. but my little town is not historic. it has never been an important place. it has some historical buildings (from the past)",3,3
39307,166,"student: yes. we stress the important means of the city if we say the city is historic  teacher: yes, absolutely! is your hometown historic? was it important in history?",4,4
39308,166,"student: i think i understand the difference. no. my hometown is a small city.  teacher: i see! ok, lovely, i'll let you go now. speak to you on thursday, have a lovely week! well done today!",3,2
39309,166,student: ok. thanks. see you on thursday.  teacher: bye!,1,1
39311,74,teacher: hey there <student>...  student: hi <teacher> how are you doing?,2,1
39312,74,"teacher: yeah i'm good thanks....still deep into lockdown... how about you?  student: here the same, it seems it'll get till may :(",3,2
39313,74,teacher: yes i see...another few weeks then...last/go on until may  student: i'm alright. a bit stressed at the moment. the online version of the training course is a chaos,3,3
39314,74,teacher: but the light's at the end of the tunnel right?  student: i don't see much light at the moment to be hones hah honest,3,3
39315,74,teacher: ah right - yes ... doing everything online is ok in theory maybe but in practice... the course is chaotic/a mess/a disaster etc  student: ok thank you,2,1
39316,74,"teacher: is it live on zoom or something?  student: yes, we meet everyday at 9 on zoom and we are there listening to our teacher until 2pm and after that we have to do a lot of exercises... so a lot of work",3,3
39317,74,teacher: wow..a long time (and mostly the teacher talking?)  student: far more than when we went to classes,2,2
39318,74,teacher: yes i see - far from ideal  student: teacher talking and students (we're 20 people) asking or interrupting.... it didn't happen before maybe it's just the beginning and i'll get better (i hope so),3,3
39319,74,teacher: yes i see- it's tricky to manage the turn-taking - does the teacher use breakout rooms?  student: can i ask you a few things i'm not sure about?,3,2
39320,74,"teacher: yes sure...  student: ohh sorry, i didn't see your question... what are breakout rooms?",2,3
39321,74,teacher: ah ...well i've just realised i think they're only available on the zoom 'pro' account but  student: i see... no we don't have pro account,2,2
39322,74,"teacher: they allow you to give people (students) time to work together in separate 'rooms' the host can enter each room when they like  student: i see, that would be great",3,3
39323,74,"teacher: yes it's very effective (i was doing lessons on zoom for a bit)  student: no, we all work at the same time so well, i'm not sure about the use of 'i' or 'me' in sentences like",3,2
39324,74,"teacher: do they use any other functions to allow/control participation? e.g. chatbox/take control of the screen function/whiteboard/screenshare (even?)/ sharing files? sorry go on...  student: maria and i went to the park', 'maria and me....', 'she and me...' , 'she and i...' my question is about when we use in these type of sentences 'me' or 'i'?",3,3
39325,74,teacher: ok so ... basically in normal everyday speaking we often say ... me and maria/maria and me = common maria and i' = more careful and some people feel this is the 'correct' way .... in writing you;d usually see thi sform  student: then both are correct?,3,2
39326,74,"teacher: in a test or if you want to copy a more careful (pedantic?!) native speaker then e.g. my friend and i = the correct option you will here tens of millions of people say the other way too (including me) so in this sense it is correct too yes  student: great, clear now... i thought that one was wrong... i was concern about using it wrongly",3,2
39327,74,"teacher: yes i understand ... they are both absolutely correct in the sense of common use ...but yes one is more informal than the other  student: actually we generally hear 'you and me...' you and i...' sounds weird, doesn't it?",3,3
39328,74,teacher: and some people would never say 'me and my friend...' yes much less common  student: what about 'you and maria are good friends'? you and she/her are good friends??,3,2
39329,74,"teacher: ok hold on...let me clear my head! so you and maria sounds fine you and he are good friends = sounds better than you and him (it;s the nominative form) more correct yes but you will hear people say 'you and him for the subject as in 'you and him can go' but less 'correct''  student: i see... in spanish it is a very common structure, maybe not so common in english?",3,3
39330,74,"teacher: yes i think that's right - that's why even though it seems such a simple phrase it's doesn't come easily to me...  student: yes, that's what i thought",3,1
39331,74,teacher: hold on ..give me a quick everyday example sentence (transalated from spanish) if you can...  student: imaging a situation in a classroom. students have to work in pairs and you say: 'marian and pablo will work together' now the same without their names 'she and he (you pointing at them) will work together??,2,3
39332,74,teacher: yes i see ... aahhhh  student: or she and him?? maybe you just say 'you two will work together' (pointing at them),2,2
39333,74,"teacher: she and he would be correct yes but just sounds weird because you'd say 'they' !!  student: i see, so let's forget about it... i was translating from spanish sorry!!!",3,3
39334,74,teacher: no that's ok - it's a fair question...just frustrating somehow and sorry yes...looking back ...exactly yes 'you two' = again the normal way  student: no frustration! i got it :) and another much easier question!!,2,4
39335,74,"teacher: ok...  student: last day (or the last day??) we talk, when we said good by to each other you said 'have a good one' what does that sentence mean? have a good day?",3,3
39336,74,"teacher: the last time we talked/when we talked the other day......and yes...have a good day is the origin i guess..but we kind of use it indiscriminately to mean e.g. weekend or whatever or just see you later alternative! informal but normal for many people sorry i'm using such lazy writing there! (ellipsis etc)  student: i see, thanks no worries!!",3,2
39337,74,"teacher: yes so many little phrases for hello/goodbye i guess! which ones did you pick up? i was always say 'hasta luego' i think in spanish and never anything else! i don't know if that matters or not really!  student: not many i think... for hello just hi or hello and for goodbye see you, bye (never goodbye, i don't know why)",3,3
39338,74,teacher: yes sure well that's fine! 'alright?' is of course very common right?  student: some people say just 'later'?,3,2
39339,74,teacher: um...'later' by itself is only used by some young people i would say....but possible yes (or 'laters' -= another form used by some young people....god this is making me feel old!)  student: haha,3,3
39340,74,"teacher: most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see you if you see what i mean)  student: and night for goodnight no sorry, i don't understand the explanation of 'seeya'",1,2
39341,74,teacher: yes so your idea about 'goodbye' being unusual is correct - 'bye' by itself = a thousand times more normal ...'goodbye' sounds very final/formal (weird!) so obviiously we say 'see you' and miss out the 'later ' at the end very often ...but many (most!) students pronounce the 'you' with a strong form of the vowel you know?  student: yes,3,1
39342,74,teacher: but we use the weak form (the 'schwa' remember?) and it sounds weird otherwise so in writing this is represented as 'ya'  student: yes,3,1
39343,74,teacher: ok  student: question if we change the pronunciation the meaning changes?,2,2
39344,74,teacher: um...no sorry i didn't mean that ...hold on asec..  student: ahhh okk ahhh okk,1,1
39345,74,teacher: so non-native don't use weak forms very much it' s true and it basically doesn't matter that much really but we do yes and it can change the meaning but we understand that if you use them/don't use them it's not changing the meaning because you only have one form! you see what i mean?  student: yes i see <teacher> : most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see you if you see what i mean),3,3
39346,74,teacher: ok! it's just taht for some reason the non-native failure to use the weak vowel in the phrase 'see ya' is particularly noticeable ... but it doesn't really matter!  student: i got the idea of a different meaning after reading that sentence i copied above,3,2
39347,74,"teacher: yes i see what you mean - tricky to talk about pronunciation issues in this format! i do a lot of pronunciation normally in classes  student: sure, again we miss the audio!",3,3
39348,74,"teacher: yes oh well  student: then, you suggest that i don't use 'see ya' ??",2,1
39349,74,teacher: oh no - it's fine ! keep using it no problem!  student: okkk,3,0
39350,74,"teacher: have you noticed people saying alright' for 'hello' a lot?  student: no, never ahh yes",3,2
39351,74,teacher: ah interesting! that's what i use very often ...  student: but i thought it meant are you alright?,4,3
39352,74,teacher: ok ..this is very common informally (not everyone uses it ) ah yes i see...it can mean this but it's just become so generuc generic...  student: ahhh,2,2
39353,74,teacher: so the other person will just reply 'alright' - you see?! it's not a real question but you can answer it a real question if you like!  student: i don't like it! same in spain... we could say 'qu tal?' instead of 'hola',3,3
39354,74,teacher: as a real question i mean yes i see...i always found it intimidating when spanish people said e.g. que pasa/que dices ....  student: i don't like it because the person who is saying 'qu tal?' usually is not interested in if you are well or not,3,3
39355,74,teacher: like i had to have some interesting answer yes i see! what about 'cheers' for 'bye' ? have you noticed that much?  student: haha i don't think they are expecting an interesting answer... i think it's just a different way of saying hello,2,2
39356,74,teacher: ok that's a relief  student: in argentina it is worse,2,1
39357,74,teacher: ?  student: they ask qu haces? what are you doing?,1,2
39358,74,teacher: ok right...yes scary!  student: so i use to explain what i was doing and they don't care haha,2,1
39359,74,"teacher: :)  student: i used sorry, not anymore",2,0
39360,74,"teacher: ok cheers <student> - have a good one and i'll speak to you on thursday ok? see ya....  student: yes, thank you very much have a good one you too :)",4,2
39362,254,student: hello <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?,2,2
39363,254,"student: how are you? i'm good. it's raining cats and dogs right now in kyiv  teacher: good, thank you! oh really? it's been raining here for days, i'm so fed up with it! but they're promising ___ sun for the weekend!",3,3
39364,254,student: does it generally rain often where you live?  teacher: the / a / 0 article?,1,1
39365,254,"student: yaya! the sun oh no sun  teacher: no, we're the 'dry counties' of the east!",1,3
39366,254,"student: that's great  teacher: yes, exactly, 0 article because i mean 'sunshine', don't i so basically, all the rain and wind move in from the atlantic, ireland and the west of the country get hit worst but it loses a lot of its force by the time it gets to the east",3,2
39367,254,"student: yes! i remembered but only after i wrote 'the sun')))  teacher: it? they? the rain and wind, so they! sorry! it still counts!",3,3
39368,254,student: haha i didn't even notice) no worries  teacher: thank you!,2,2
39369,254,"student: which part of england is hit the most then? i mean, has the heaviest rains  teacher: the west, definitely! that's where storms are the worst. and wales, too. wales is the rainiest part of the uk i think",4,3
39370,254,"student: noted  teacher: i've been so fed up with all the rain, but then, my italian student just told me it had rained non-stop in italy as well, so i'm a bit more reconciled with it now :)",3,2
39371,254,"student: noted - not my travel destination then))  teacher: haha, well, it's supposed to be beautiful, but i've never been. very green (because of all the rain) like ireland :) i still don't dare travel to scotland even though it's supposed to be breathtakingly beautiful, for the same reason",3,3
39372,254,"student: sure. must be good for the plants  teacher: that's it! ok, unfortunately, i've got to tell you that we're closing down the teaching program on june 18. also, i will be taking next week off (<teacher's child>'s going to be on holiday), which leaves us two classes between june 7 and 18",2,1
39373,254,"student: oh no!  teacher: we will get on with the writing now, but for the other two, please let me know if there's something you'd particularly like to do!",3,2
39374,254,"student: are you ok with them closing the program? yes, the writing... )) let's try  teacher: yes, it's a shame for me too, it's been such fun! and we're very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself :)",4,3
39375,254,student: it has been a blast!  teacher: it certainly has!!,3,2
39376,254,"student: i'm really going to miss our classes you're the best teacher  teacher: aww, thank you! yes, me too! i love our conversations!",4,3
39377,254,"student: well! i hope we'll continue conversing from time to time but on facebook in a more relaxed setting, preferably an essay-free one))))))  teacher: definitely!! i promise no essays on facebook :))",4,4
39378,254,student: joking ^.^ yay!))) ok. then it's time to finally write it  teacher: and we do hope to go to kyiv at some point! maybe next easter...,2,3
39379,254,"student: oh! that's fantastic news. if you do come, i really hope to meet you all  teacher: yep! have you got the writing paper handy? could you re-read the two paragraphs about advertising? and i'll retrieve the sentences you wrote last time that would be great!",3,2
39380,254,"student: ready with the papee paper  teacher: lovely! since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. 1) some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help 2) others think their ubiquity is annoying even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people 3) i think ads are ok when there's an option to mute or cancel them. in real world it's almost impossible to achieve. thus, i only support ads on the internet",4,3
39381,254,student: i'm terribly sorry to ask for the millionth (?) time but could you possible tell me again the pages and the book's name  teacher: this was the plan from the last time,3,1
39382,254,student: possibly* did i write this? whoa  teacher: no worries! it's the writing sample paper pdf that i emailed you last time! so it should be in your inbox right? as i keep saying :)),4,2
39383,254,"student: ok i've got it  teacher: lovely! could you re-read the paragraphs about advertising, please?",3,1
39384,254,"student: so i read again. then try to write an essay including my previous sentences ok, sure  teacher: yes! i think this first sentence could be a good start, what do you think? since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.",4,3
39385,254,student: agree  teacher: feel free to add a couple of sentences for the intro,2,1
39386,254,student: one quick question  teacher: sure,2,1
39387,254,"student: what do you think the author means by 'digital advertising' in the second article? digital billboards or internet ads i mean, digital billboards on the streets  teacher: that's a good question, i've been thinking myself! i think they mean digital billboards, because it needs to correlate with the first paragraph and the contrast is, posters in the past vs. digital billboards now or at least it must be!",3,3
39388,254,"student: ok. so it probably correlates with the previous artcile article  teacher: yes, it should! two views of the same thing",3,2
39389,254,"student: if that's not the case then i would have argued differently. hence the question  teacher: so let's stick to the idea of digital billboards aha, i see! how?",3,3
39390,254,student: yes. haha i need to thinl think  teacher: sure!,2,1
39391,254,"student: something about that there's no escape from the advertising frenzy, neither online, not offline. and you'll have to become immune at some point and maybe teach your children to do the same, see through things neither ... nor  teacher: yes, i see! your original point was that we have no choice when exposed to billboards, we can't block them like on the internet",3,3
39392,254,"student: yes.  teacher: shall we go at paragraphs one by one, and then you choose which idea you'd like to express? or potentially both",3,2
39393,254,"student: that's if we think about digital boards on the streets i'd like to continue expressing the first one so i have to write by hand the whole essay now, right?  teacher: i think it's a very promising one, easy to write about!",2,3
39394,254,"student: yes, much easier.  teacher: can you type it here, please, sentence by sentence? you've got the first sentence!",3,1
39395,254,student: here? ok!  teacher: and i'll be saving them for you,3,1
39396,254,"student: in 2 mins i'll start, ok?  teacher: sure!",3,1
39397,254,student: ok. ready to start  teacher: lovely! since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. the first sentence again,3,3
39398,254,"student: it is hard to imagine a single day when you're not bombarded with advertisements, in one way or another.  teacher: yes, 'bombarded with' = lovely!",2,3
39399,254,"student: you may think it's necessary or you may be appalled - one thing is clear, there's little you can do about it. however, this is only partly true for the virtual world.  teacher: right, i'm just thinking... are we still in the introduction part? there's surely more than one way about it, but shall we say for now, 1)a general introduction 2) opinion 1 3) opinion 2 4) your opinion",3,4
39400,254,"student: i'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes - even those people have an ad-blocker installed on their pcs. maybe omit 'even those people'?  teacher: ok, that's a great sentence, but you are going back to billboards, aren't you?? yes, a comma after landscapes and 'have an ad-blocker...'",3,3
39401,254,"student: i'm trying to continue what i wrote last time. or we're doing a new version? so i need more introduction then, right?  teacher: no, you're right, we're building on the old one! i would say so, and then proceed to the next paragraph that can start with a topic sentence boring, but well-structured! ah, i've got to let you go! shall we continue in two weeks' time?",3,2
39402,254,"student: sure. i'll try to maybe write it on my own  teacher: sure, feel free to email it to me then!",3,1
39403,254,"student: thank you!  teacher: ok, lovely. thursday june 10, same time?",2,1
39404,254,student: that's right!  teacher: great! looking forward to it!,3,2
39405,254,student: see you soon!  teacher: bye!,1,1
39407,52,"teacher: hi there...  student: hey, i am here",2,1
39408,52,"teacher: ok so, let's have a think about this again <student> ok? don't answer yet but here is what we're going to do: 'i saw this when you_______(teach) us.' so <student>....what action happened first? you seeing the table or me teaching you?  student: i seeing table firstly",3,2
39409,52,teacher: are you sure? was i your teacher before that?!  student: wow..you teach us first and then gave to us the table chart,2,3
39410,52,"teacher: ok good! and was i also your teacher after you saw the table?  student: yes, you are also my teacher.",1,2
39411,52,"teacher: ok fine! so we have two actions right? one of them ('seeing the table' ) happened 'inside' the other - the second one existed (me teaching you) existed before, during and after the other so do we use the past simple for both actions?  student: no,,i think one of them is past perfect",4,3
39412,52,"teacher: ah ok i see your idea...well past perfect is some that happened before something else -but this is different because the other thing happened before, during and after ok?  student: yes",2,2
39413,52,teacher: ok <student> so imagine: i look out of my window and i see a man i have never seen before ok? maybe i ask myself: at the moment...what ________(do)? choose a tense <student> to complete the question!  student: what are you doing? what should i do?,3,3
39414,52,teacher: ok yes good exactly: 'what's he doing? ' and the answer maybe is: 'nothing special ...he ___ just ____ (walk) along the street'  student: he is just walking along the street.,3,4
39415,52,teacher: ok good thanks hold on so two action right? which one started first? (the seeing or the walking?)  student: walking is the first action,3,3
39416,52,"teacher: ok good fine so...we have two tenses: the present simple and the present continuous ok?  student: and during he is walking, i saw him, after i seeing him, he still walking along the street.",2,2
39417,52,"teacher: yes exactly good! so the seeing is 'inside' the walking!  student: yes,ok",2,1
39418,52,teacher: so...your original sentence was : 'i saw this when you_______(teach) us.' this is in the past it's true but the logic is the same...  student: so...i saw the table when you teaching us. because you are my teacher before you give to me the table and during you giving and after you giving to me,2,2
39419,52,teacher: so the first verb is in the past simple good ...and the second needs to be the....?? yes yes that's it!  student: wow..i got it i never understand it before you teaching me this stuff.,4,3
39420,52,teacher: yes that's ok ...so you need the past continuous - how do we make it? we need to two parts remember? the present continuous ____ing and the past continuous?  student: was/were + __ing,4,2
39421,52,teacher: ok great so...'i__________ it when you ____ ______ us.'??  student: i saw it the when you were teaching us.,2,1
39422,52,teacher: ok fantastic - you've got it  student: yes!! thanks,3,2
39423,52,teacher: so <student> let's just use this a bit before you forget it! hold on....  student: ok,3,1
39424,52,teacher: so i can say about myself for example: 1. i saw the first lord of the rings film when i was living in spain. 2. yesterday i was driving to the supermarket when i saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. i was going to school when i realized my phone was at home. etc etc ...can you think of a couple of examples (true if possible - but they don't have to be interesting!) for yourself?)  student: i understood the stuffs of present continuous when i was study online. i understood the stuffs of present continuous when i was studying online.,2,2
39425,52,teacher: ok thanks - the second one = correct good try one more if you can ok?  student: yes,3,1
39426,52,teacher: ok...  student: i was learning in cambridge when i visited to london with my friends.,2,3
39427,52,"teacher: ok cool - you've got it i think...  student: yes,,i always need to think which actions is a big in order to confirm the other is inside it.",2,2
39428,52,"teacher: yes ok i see - it'll get more automatic over time if you keep practising... <student> - let me give you a couple of examples about how you can use the present perfect or present continuous in ielts essays ok? hold on a sec....  student: okey, i still practising this sentence after class.",3,2
39429,52,teacher: ok good  student: okey,1,0
39430,52,"teacher: by the way ..you vcan save them and copy and paste your examples in our lesson tomorrow if you like ok?  student: yes, i like",3,2
39431,52,"teacher: hi sorry - internet went out there for a minute ok <student> so let me give you a few typical sentences for essay introductions and we can think about the use of the present perfect/present continuous....hold on remember the problem and solution essay we did in class about the lack of teachers?  student: yes ,it is always happen...firstly i am unhappy with that.. but i rebased i need to clam down and get a good mood with this problem.",3,3
39432,52,"teacher: yes you're right ...count to ten and keep calm....  student: yes, i still remembering the easy of problem and solution.",3,2
39433,52,teacher: ok right...so in the intro maybe we might want to say (for the background sentence) something like: ' the number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' can you put the verb in the right tense?  student: decline decrease,3,3
39434,52,teacher: so you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! but what tense?? you can copy the verb  student: declined/decreased/went down,3,3
39435,52,"teacher: ok thanks so you;ve chosen the past simple which maybe seems logical but the time phrase 'in recent decades' means up to and including now so....we need the...??  student: in this intro, do we need the structure of ' it is argued that...' we need the present continuous",4,2
39436,52,"teacher: um....not really beacuse the lack of teachers would be given as a fact not an opinion or disagree with you see? to agree or disagree with i mean  student: okey,i understand",2,3
39437,52,teacher: ok so if i say 'this year' has the time finished?  student: if we got the date of this year i think it finished.,2,3
39438,52,"teacher: ah well if we say e.g. 24th march 2020 then yes it;s finished but if we only say 'this year' has it finished?  student: no ,it not finished so we use present simple or present continue",3,4
39439,52,"teacher: ok good - so some time phrases automatically need the past simple or the present perfect ok? it depends on the phrase  student: okey, i understand.",3,2
39440,52,teacher: so e.g. last year/last week/2018/ = ? (past simple or present perfect?)  student: present simple because it is specific time,3,3
39441,52,teacher: ok fine (you mean past simple right?!)  student: yes,2,2
39442,52,teacher: ok! ok good! and one more...what about 'this morning' ? past simple or present perfect? in real life today!  student: this morning is...past simple i guess,3,3
39443,52,teacher: yes good!  student: because everyday and every time is specific.,2,2
39444,52,teacher: yes that's right - ok so finally: 'in recent decades'? past simple or present perfect? remember the logic of the essay question is : we have a problem now with a lack of teachers.  student: let me think past simple!,3,3
39445,52,"teacher: ok so remember the result will be either: 'in recent decades the number of teachers has gone down...' or 'in recent decades the number of teachers went down....  student: because in recent year is present perfect yes..in recent years this problem is big action, now is inside it",3,4
39446,52,teacher: yes good! that keyword is 'recent' which makes us use the present perfect in english because ot means up to and including now you see? not a finished time with less connection to now...  student: yes.. i think i can understand it now,3,3
39447,52,teacher: yes i see what you mean about 'inside it' - i guess that;s true - in other words the number of teachers hasn't exactly stopped going down that's right we'll do more tomorrow with more essay intros ok?  student: yes that is what i like to do,3,2
39448,52,teacher: ok great thanks <student> see you tomorrow...  student: see you cheers,2,1
39449,52,teacher: bye..  student: thanks a lot bey,1,0
39451,172,"student: hello, <teacher>.  teacher: hi <student>! how are you?",3,1
39452,172,"student: long time no see. i'm fine.  teacher: yes, it's been a while. good to speak to you again!",3,2
39453,172,student: me too!  teacher: did you celebrate new year? or is it not a celebration in china and you're waiting for chinese new year to celebrate?,3,3
39454,172,"student: yes. we didn't celebrate the new year, but we have 3 days holiday. in china, we just celebrate the chinese new year.  teacher: ok, i see, it makes sense! did you have a nice break over the new year in this case?",3,2
39455,172,"student: i didn't go out because the holiday was not long.  teacher: oh, it wasn't long enough, i see!",3,1
39456,172,"student: but i went to the gym.  teacher: we had a long holiday, but we didn't go out because we are under yet another lockdown. the virus situation is really bad in the uk at the moment!",3,2
39457,172,student: sorry to hear that.  teacher: thank you. we deserve it for not acting as efficiently and responsibly as you did in china!,4,2
39458,172,"student: hope the pandemic would go away soon.  teacher: yes, me too! the uk now has two vaccines, they are trying to vaccinate as fast as possible",3,3
39459,172,student: yes. i hear that the vaccines are more efficient .  teacher: how's your book going? have you been reading more in english?,2,2
39460,172,"student: yes. i still read the book.  teacher: ok, are you enjoying it? which bit are you reading about at the moment?",3,3
39461,172,"student: yes. but i can't remember the names from it. they have a match.  teacher: oh, a quidditch match? where they fly on brooms?",3,4
39462,172,"student: yes!  teacher: ah, exciting! ok, i thought we could practise a bit of vocabulary using some ideas from harry potter. in particular, personality adjectives (the adjectives that describe what kind of person someone is) you know how the sorting hat puts students into four different houses at hogwarts? can you remember what kind of students get into gryffindor, harry potter's house?",3,4
39463,172,"student: yes. i remenber that.  teacher: ok, so what kind of person does one need to be to get into gryffindor?",3,3
39464,172,"student: sorry. is it brave?  teacher: yes, that's what i am looking for! brave is a good adjective, or another one is 'courageous' brave' and 'courageous' are synonyms",3,4
39465,172,student: ok.  teacher: do you know the noun for 'courageous'? the quality of being courageous #error!,3,1
39466,172,"student: couragement?  teacher: ah, nearly courage",2,2
39467,172,"student: ok.  teacher: an uncountable noun ok, so students who get sorted into gryffindor are brave / courageous, well done! what about ravenclaw? if you remember",4,3
39468,172,"student: clever?  teacher: yes, correct! do you know any synonyms for 'clever'? clever = ?",4,3
39469,172,"student: intellegent?  teacher: yes, well done! there's also 'bright' in british english and 'smart' in american english e.g. she is a very bright student!",3,4
39470,172,"student: ok.  teacher: ok, well done! what about slytherin?",3,2
39471,172,"student: sorry. i can't remember.  teacher: no worries, slytherin students are supposed to have big career goals they are ambitious",3,3
39472,172,"student: but may be honest? oh,yes  teacher: ah, i think you're thinking about hufflepuff where everyone is honest and nice slytherin is the house of draco malfoy, ambitious and sometimes actually dishonest",3,3
39473,172,"student: yes.  teacher: if a person is clever and can get what they want in a dishonest way, we can call them 'cunning'",3,2
39474,172,"student: ok.  teacher: in european fairy tales, a fox is often cunning. clever and dishonest. is there an animal in chinese stories that is associated with being cunning?",3,4
39475,172,"student: i think you china also it's fox. in china  teacher: ok, fair enough! a fox it is! i think it's because foxes are so clever and they can steal chickens from farms, so farmers think they are cunning",3,3
39476,172,"student: yes. in chinese history books, there are a lot of stories about foxes.  teacher: would you say 'ambitious' is a positive or negative quality? ah, interesting! i didn't know that!",3,2
39477,172,"student: i think ambitious is a negative quality in this place.  teacher: i see what you mean, maybe in the context of slytherin. but generally in english 'ambitious' is positive, actually",3,3
39478,172,"student: ok.  teacher: if a person is ambitious, they want to achieve goals in life, maybe in their career and they are comfortable with becoming leaders, for example",3,2
39479,172,"student: so it's a good word to describe people.  teacher: yes, i would say so! the noun is 'ambition', what you want to achieve for example, it's your ambition to become a phd student at fudan university, isn't it?",3,3
39480,172,"student: yes! it's my ambition.  teacher: yes! so you're an ambitious person :) ok, we've got one last house left. hufflepuff students tend to be honest as you said and also...??",3,2
39481,172,"student: is there a word to describe the negative means of ambition in english?  teacher: good question, let me have a think!",3,3
39482,172,"student: i'm not sure, but in china i think ambition is to describe good goals, someone is ambitious may tell a negtive quality. and hufflepuff students tend to be honest and loyalty, i think.  teacher: i see! i meant 'ambitious' in a very positive way when i said you were ambitious",3,2
39483,172,student: yes.  teacher: i think 'ambitious' can be positive or negative depending on a situation,3,1
39484,172,"student: yes.  teacher: for example, schools try to support girls to be more ambitious #error! you can also desribe an ambitious person as 'an achiever'. someone for whom achievement is very important it can sometimes be an unpleasant quality!",3,2
39485,172,"student: yes. in china there are words to describe people is positively ambitious or negtively ambitious. but when i translate them to english, they are both the same word 'ambitious'.  teacher: oh, i know! someone who is ambitious in a negative way is 'vain'",3,3
39486,172,"student: ok.  teacher: someone who seeks status, likes to talk about themselves all the time, likes to be praised is vain someone who places to much importance on their achievements or appearance, actually",3,2
39487,172,"student: ok.  teacher: an example from the dictionary: he was very vain about his hair and clothes *sorry, too much importance",2,1
39488,172,"student: so vain is an always negtive word.  teacher: yes, that's right! vain is always negative, and ambitious is quite positive",3,2
39489,172,"student: ok.  teacher: ok, back to hufflepuff! loyalty is a noun, the adjective is...? you need to lose two letters",3,3
39490,172,"student: loyal  teacher: yes, cool! and they are also supposed to be kind-hearted and patient and the opposite of vain = humble",3,2
39491,172,"student: so they are all nice people in hufflepuff.  teacher: if a person is humble, they don't like to talk about their success or achievements yes, they are basically nice people in hufflepuff, yes :)",3,3
39492,172,student: ok.  teacher: which house do you think you would be sorted into? :) and i'll tell you mine,3,2
39493,172,"student: i think i should be in hufflepuff. but i like to be in gryffindor.  teacher: oh, that's very nice! i'd love to be in gryffindor too, but the pottermore quiz sorted me into ravenclaw. i'll send you a link to the quiz if you'd like, it's fun! do you think courage is important then?",4,3
39494,172,"student: yes. i want the link.  teacher: yes, sure, i'll pop it into an email to you",2,2
39495,172,"student: and yes, i think courage is important.  teacher: why?",2,3
39496,172,"student: we always want to do something which makes us curious, and in this case, we should have courage to try.  teacher: yes, good point! we need to be courageous to try new things!",3,2
39497,172,"student: and people are always afraid of unknown things.  teacher: ok, thank you. the new words for today are courageous, courage, bright / smart, humble, kind-hearted, patient, ambitious, an achiever and vain (maybe not all of them are new). if you are learning them, could you make sure you check the pronunciation, please? yes, i agree with you!",3,1
39498,172,"student: ok. i will heck the pronunciation.  teacher: sorry for keeping you for a few extra minutes, i'll let you go now!",3,2
39499,172,student: check  teacher: speak to you on thursday :),2,1
39501,163,"student: hi, <teacher>!  teacher: hiya! oh my, this time i couldn't type my name :) how are you?",3,2

39508,163,"student: keep meaning? i've been really into ? )  teacher: if a person keeps meaning to do something, they have wanted to do something for a long time but haven't actually done it i keep meaning to clean out my kitchen cupboards)) i keep meaning to read moby dick",4,2
39509,163,"student: haha  teacher: :) yes, it's a very useful one",2,1
39510,163,"student: i keep meaning to do lots of things in my life )))  teacher: that's it! to be into something = to like something, especially as a hobby, when you enjoy doing something i'm into gardening, for example a person can be into detective stories, tom cruise movies - whatever maybe someone can even be into moby dick :)",4,3
39511,163,student: haha  teacher: what are you into?,3,2
39512,163,student: i'm into pilates and yoga now i'm into english  teacher: definitely!,1,1

39514,163,student: actually i've discussed it with my friend and student  teacher: what did they think?,3,2
39515,163,"student: that french guy and he asked me a good question he told me i wonder if that soviet people really were waiting for her in moscow it was a period of cold war what do you think?  teacher: oh, the kgb tax driver? or the people who wanted her autographs?",3,3
39516,163,student: second ones  teacher: *taxi driver,1,1
39517,163,"student: like fans what do you think it could be real situation? i think so *could it be the real situation?  teacher: hmm, but you know how people used to sneak deep purple and beatles records into the soviet union, and secretly listened to bbc on their radios another good correction :) i think people secretly loved everything foreign, and then in public said they only loved soviet things :)",4,3
39518,163,"student: yes, i think it's more realistic than the uniform of soviet stewardess )  teacher: of course, some people were fanatical about everything soviet yes, definitely. i think it's a good one to ask our parents about",3,2
39519,163,"student: i think he was hesitating about if the soviet government let people stay and wait for the american girl *lets hm past form  teacher: yes, i see. well, i suppose they couldn't control everyting. the beatles visited ussr, and people adored them let-let-let so the past form is 'let', you were right",3,3
39520,163,student: so first option was the right one )))  teacher: yes!,1,1
39521,163,student: as usual i've done then i'm hesitating ))  teacher: and you know how people were crazy about jeans and things like that,2,2
39522,163,student: yes! so i think that it could be in the real life  teacher: and gone with the wind :),2,1
39523,163,"student: i mean the people crowd  teacher: just trying to think of examples of american things that people liked. the beatles weren't american, obviously :)",2,2
39524,163,"student: actually i've never understood it )) i mean gone with the wind  teacher: i think it's the same in russia now. on tv, the usa is blamed for everything and many people do believe it, but in practice people love american movies, actors etc. and want to move there",3,3
39525,163,student: it's not my favorite story )  teacher: what do you dislike about it?,4,3
39526,163,student: i'm just not crazy about the story )  teacher: fair enough! it's not my favourite either!,3,2
39527,163,"student: not bad, but.. )  teacher: if the queen's gambit was more realistic, the stewardess wouldn't wear an ugly uniform in it this is a way to talk about 'the unreal present or future'",3,3
39528,163,student: moby dck is much better )))))) dick  teacher: things in the present or future that are not what is actually true,1,2
39529,163,"student: it's a joke ))  teacher: but you know, people like to think about fantasy things)) oh, have you read moby dick?",3,3
39530,163,student: no ))  teacher: neither have i :) this is called 'second conditional',3,2
39531,163,"student: actually it's funny  teacher: if past simple, would / could / might vinfinitive",1,1
39532,163,"student: i would like to type that i don't like jack london either but it's not his book ))))  teacher: oh, i liked jack london when i was young!",3,2
39533,163,"student: ok! it's about 'second conditional' <student's husband> likes him i don't like actually (  teacher: yes, this is another use for the modal verbs 'would / could / might'",3,1
39534,163,"student: it's quite boring to me  teacher: just like with modal verbs of deduction, you think about what 'might' happen, but you can't be sure, because it's a fantasy situation",2,1
39535,163,student: i like dostoevsky for example he is much funnier ))))  teacher: oh reallly? dostoevsky is not something i would read for pleasure! but read most his novels at school funnier? i never thought of dostoevsky as a funny guy :),3,3
39536,163,student: haha it was a joke  teacher: :)),2,1
39537,163,"student: i mean than if i can say that jack london is boring and then i say that dostoevsky is better  teacher: if dostoevsky was a bit funnier, i would probably like him!",4,3
39538,163,"student: i have to resume that dostoevsky is not boring )))) but it's not true )  teacher: well, i suppose he is not boring. it's just that everyone suffers in his books",3,2

39625,94,"teacher: yes, true  student: they tried to call them , but they couldn't get through",1,3

39632,94,"teacher: ok, lovely. have a great time in lviv!  student: thank you! have a nice day)",3,2
39634,62,student: hi  teacher: hi...,1,0
39635,62,student: i am here  teacher: so: 'one of the most significant negative effects children playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour.' = good! ...effects of... i mean sorry ready to carry on?,3,1
39636,62,"student: so..after 'of' we can write the whole sentence with subjective ,verb and subjective right? objective i think sometime after 'of' we write a noun  teacher: well bot are possible but we use 'that' before a clause (subject + verb) so ...you can say e.g. 'the effect of smoking is cancer.'. or e.g. the effect of smoking is that the chances of cancer are higher. 'ok?",3,3
39637,62,"student: okey, thanks  teacher: so the effect of x is noun ...or the effect of x is that + clause (subject and verb) or e.g. the effect of x is adjective (common actually) so for example : 'the effects of smoking are terrible.'",3,2
39638,62,student: i understand...thanks  teacher: ok no problem..so ready to try the next sentence?,3,1
39639,62,"student: yes, i am reday  teacher: ok go for it....i'll wait....",1,1
39640,62,"student: it is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality. ,because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent contexts.  teacher: ok thanks <student>...i'll come back to the language here later ok? so next you're going to say that children copy the violence in some way?",2,3
39641,62,"student: yes,,as result of.............. as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.  teacher: ok thanks <student> - have you finished? here is your paragraph - i'll give you a minute to see if you want to change anything ok? don't worry if you can't think of anything and try not to make really big changes ok?1 it is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality. because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent contexts. as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.",2,2
39642,62,"student: yes, that all  teacher: ok thanks hold on... ok thanks <student>....i get the idea of your first sentence: it is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality....so to make this clearer in english we have a few options ok?! one choice would be to add the words 'the difference' e.g. the difference between e.g. it is difficult for children to tell the difference between video games and reality. a more formal verb is distinguish e.g. it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. or you could also say: it is difficult for children to realise that video games are not real.! but you can't say; ...'realise between...' which one do you want to choose now?",4,3
39643,62,"student: it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality.  teacher: ok nice! here's your next one coming up ...can i ask you to think about your use ofsingular and plural here please? because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent content. by te way you can see i have changed contexts to 'content' - this is a good noun here ok?",3,2
39644,62,"student: okey, i saw it...i think adult is may a singular  teacher: um...'adults' is ok if you're talking about adults in general! hold on your noun is 'some games' and this is fine...but what comes next? singular or plural?",3,1
39645,62,student: are  teacher: ok good and the next word you have to change to the plural?? again it connects back to 'some games' a tiny little word...! you ok <student>? ok sorry - i'll help! you need to change 'it' to 'they' oh maybe you're having internet issues?!,3,2
39646,62,student: sorry.. so...because some games are for adults to forget pressured and sometime it may have violent contents.  teacher: ok good ...thanks <student> ...small grammar changes it's true but i want you to get into the habit of seeing these mistakes so you change them (and eventually not make them in the first place!),3,3
39647,62,"student: yes,, i will get them into my habit,thanks  teacher: ok so your last sentence was: 'as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.' what does 'teas' mean here?? ah sorry i get it now ! you mean the verb 'tease' right?",3,3
39648,62,student: i think the meaning here is that fight with other students who are not strong in class.  teacher: yes ok ok ...maybe 'bully' is a good verb here - do you know that word?,4,3
39649,62,student: no... but i study it now  teacher: ok fine...yes so e.g. 'some children bully others.' 'some children are bullies.' (noun for person) some children are bullied at school = passive and finally ....the name of the problem = bullying ....so.....bullying is a serious problem in some schools ok?!,3,4
39650,62,"student: yes, so...as a result bullying is a serious problem in some school  teacher: yes ok good! check for singular/plural mistakes <student> if you can please!!",3,2
39651,62,"student: schools!! as a result of, bullying is a serious problem in some schools.  teacher: ok good wel ldone ok <student> the bit in capital letters needs changing ok? as a result, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, and bullying is a serious problem in some schools. this is a structure you have used before and we need to get this right! if you're not sure of an idea of how to change it tell me and we'll do it together ok?",4,3
39652,62,student: i am not sure...  teacher: that's ok! hold on... so for example we could use lots of possible phrases to explain the connection between seeing the violence and copying it ok?,3,3
39653,62,student: ok'  teacher: one question: if i roll two dice the chances of me getting a double six are _______? any ideas for the adjective? don't worry if not! just tell me... high or low?,3,2
39654,62,student: impossible low  teacher: ok thanks! so another way of saying this could be: 'it is very _______ that you will get a double six.'? unl_ _ _ _ _ _ '??,2,3
39655,62,student: unl....  teacher: unlikely! so if children play violent video games they are _______ to copy the behaviour they see.' likely or unlikely?,3,4
39656,62,student: wow.. it is very unlikely that you will get a double six sorry.....  teacher: ok yes good! and the next example? that's ok!,2,1
39657,62,student: likely  teacher: ok good ...so this is one way you can explain that connection ok? instead of using 'easy',3,2
39658,62,"student: yes,,it become more academic  teacher: ok fine....<student> i'll copy the final complete paragraph and we can give it a final review tomorrow ok? thanks for your concentration and hard work today! enjoy your hotel (sorry!)",3,3
39659,62,student: yes..thank you very much.  teacher: ok thanks bye for now,2,1

45840,154,"teacher: i had a nice weekend. my son and i decorated a christmas tree and watched a christmas movie and my husband made some lovely food what a good idea! i've realized i probably never went to a proper bookshop like this when we lived in shanghai, because i don't speak chinese  student: sounds great!",3,2
45841,154,"teacher: but we enjoyed a local dvd shop there :) ok, <student>, shall we have a look at b2 writing part 2?  student: ok.",3,1
45842,154,"teacher: the word count for part 2 is the same as for part 1 (140-190 words), but you can choose your task out of 3 options all tasks in part 2 are imaginary / pretend situations. for example, write an article for an english magazine or write to your english-speaking friend not a real magazine and not a real friend, just an imaginary situation  student: ok.",3,0
45843,154,"teacher: but, depending on the situation, your writing has to be a bit different. for example, if it's an email to a friend, you probably want to start with 'hi &lt;friend's name&gt;.' and end with 'best wishes, <student>' or something like that and if it's an article, you don't have to do any of these, you basically write an essay just like in part 1, it's important to answer all the questions that the task gives you  student: ok.",4,1
45844,154,teacher: have you got that pdf with writing tasks that i sent you earlier?  student: yes. i'm reading the questions.,3,2
45845,154,"teacher: lovely! as you can see, the choice is a book review, an article and an informal email (to a friend)  student: yes. so which one is better for me.",4,3
45846,154,"teacher: which one do you like best? i know you love books, but one thing to make sure of with a book review is being able to remember the name of the book, the characters and the author in english i think we might practise all of them, one at a time, if you'd like they are all very useful  student: ok. i think i need some time to remember the names in the book. so the first time i think i will not choose the book review.",3,4
45847,154,"teacher: ok, very wise i think! an article or an email then?  student: ok. an article.",3,2
45848,154,"teacher: ok, the most useful thing you have ever learned! what do you think this thing can be?  student: sorry. i dont have a clear idea about this topic. some characters? like honest, brave?",3,3
45849,154,"teacher: no worries, let me give you an example. no, just a useful skill you learned for example, when i was at school, i learned to touch type (type without looking). this is one of the most useful skills that i've learned, it has saved me so much time because i can type very fast  student: ok, i know.",3,1
45850,154,"teacher: or, when i was 4 years old, i learned to swim. it's one of the most useful things i've learned because when i fell in a pool i could swim out. also, it means i enjoy seaside holidays cooking, starting a campfire, riding a bike - all useful skills ok? what do you think? playing a musical instrument  student: when i was at high school, i learned computer programming. this is one of the most useful skills that i've learned.",4,3
45851,154,"teacher: wonderful example, yes! you will need to explain why it's been so useful to you  student: it helped me go deep in computer world, and changed my life. now i'm an engineer in a company.",4,4
45852,154,"teacher: and then, in the next paragraph, answer the question, who you learned it from yes, good!  student: this place 'who' is a real person or something like a website?",3,2
45853,154,"teacher: a real person! if it was a website or school, it would be 'where did you learn it from' but if there was no real person, you can just describe how you learned it  student: i learnt it from my old borther who was a video game developer.",3,3
45854,154,"teacher: ok, lovely. we say 'elder brother'  student: ok.",2,1
45855,154,"teacher: because what's important here is not that he might be old, but that he is older than you and with brothers/sisters, we use 'elder' instead of 'older'  student: ok.",3,2
45856,154,"teacher: cool, is your brother still a video game developer? you can use the present tense if he is  student: yes.",3,3
45857,154,"teacher: i learnt it from my elder brother, who is a video game developer. lovely, could you say a bit about why it is a useful skill?  student: during the progress, it showed me how to use computer codes to build a virual world. and the most important thing is that learning to coding helps me get a good job.",3,4
45858,154,"teacher: ok, nice long sentences, a couple of problems here it showed me how...' what's 'it' in this sentence? maybe, my brother showed me...?  student: yes. my brother showed me ...",3,2
45859,154,"teacher: yes, good! ok, and could you put the second sentence in the past tense? what do you need to change?  student: helps --&gt; helped",3,1
45860,154,"teacher: yes, well done!  student: get --&gt; got?",3,1
45861,154,"teacher: yes, correct! and also, learning to code, you need the infinitive 'to code'  student: ok.",3,1
45862,154,"teacher: some other things that might be good to write about are, how old you were when you learned to code, whether it was hard to learn, whether you liked or not things like that because you need a nice 140-190-word article :)  student: ok.",3,2
45863,154,"teacher: would you like to try one more sentence?  student: ok. i learnt to code when i was at high school. it was hard to start, because you need to let yourself think like a computer. but when my elder brother taught me how to use computer language to build a tiny game, i thought i really like these things, and i would be a coder in the future.",3,4
45864,154,"teacher: this is excellent work, <student>!  student: thanks.",4,1
45865,154,teacher: one small thing: i thought i really liked those things and i would be a coder in the future you need everything in the past  student: ok.,2,1
45866,154,teacher: and maybe 'i really liked doing it' would be clearer than 'these things'  student: yes.,3,1
45867,154,"teacher: ok, lovely. as you can guess, the homework will be to write the whole article if you have the time. feel free to use the sentences you wrote today!  student: ok.",3,1

45879,84,"student: hmm it looks like some food i think  teacher: it does, doesn't it? it's magnified of course",3,2
45880,84,student: magnified?  teacher: magnify = make an image bigger a magnifying glass is what we use to have a good look at really small objects,3,3
45881,84,student: oh okay  teacher: what food do you think it might be?,3,1
45882,84,"student: the thing in the middle looks like a piece of apple but i don't think it is  teacher: aha, so it could be... could you make a sentence with one of the modals we talked about last time?",4,3

45887,84,"student: can i ask you a question?  teacher: it's becoming more popular now, though yes sure!",3,2
45888,84,"student: what fast food restaurants are popular in uk?  teacher: good question! mcdonalds and kfc are here of course but traditional english 'fast food' or takeaway food is fish and chips there are lots of fish-and-chips shops in every town, or 'chippies'",4,4
45889,84,"student: i heard something about fish and chips  teacher: yes, it sorry it's white fish deep fried in some batter and chunky chips. quite nice but not everyday food for me!",3,3
45890,84,"student: why batter, but not butter?  teacher: then there are lots of places where you can get a coffee and a nice sandwich, such as costa, starbucks, pret-a-manger",1,1
45891,84,"student: i know starbucks! i want to drink some coffee there one day  teacher: oh, batter is what you make out of flour, egg, maybe a bit of milk or water, or even beer. then you put the fish in the batter and fry it you also make some batter to make pancakes!",1,2
45892,84,student: oohh  teacher: is there starbucks in kyiv?,2,3
45893,84,student: no  teacher: but i bet you've seen it in israel?,3,3
45894,84,"student: no, there is not starbucks in israel and ukraine:(  teacher: ah well, i'm sure you will one day! what is fast food like in israel? i know about kyiv! mcdonalds and domashnya kukhnya!",4,4
45895,84,student: mcdonalds is the good one but for example their burger is like our double burger!  teacher: do you mean burgers in israeli mcdonalds are bigger than in ukrainian ones?,3,4
45896,84,"student: and they don't eat cheese with meat, so when i made a burger for myself with meat and cheese, they gave me it without any cheese! yes, it is  teacher: sure, it's not kosher, right?",3,4
45897,84,"student: yes  teacher: interesting! oh, something interesting i found the other day there is a chef from ukraine, and she is taking instagram by storm in this country!",3,3
45898,84,student: it is raining now  teacher: she has written three (i think) amazing cookbooks about ukrainian cooking in english,1,1
45899,84,"student: wow  teacher: i really recommend her instagram account, @oliahercules",3,2
45900,84,"student: okay, wait a minute and i will find her  teacher: it's beautiful (and yummy!) and will be great for your english because it's all your familiar foods but in english",3,3

45907,84,student: okay then  teacher: i see! is it very different from kyiv?,3,2
45908,84,student: i think yes  teacher: in what way?,3,2
45909,84,student: kyiv is bigger  teacher: sure),1,1
45910,84,"student: and in vinnytsa there are more old people (like my grandma)  teacher: oh interesting! young people probably move to kyiv and then retire somewhere quieter, right?",3,4
45911,84,"student: and think there are more transport in vinnytsa yes, maybe  teacher: you mean there is more public transport?",3,3
45912,84,student: yes in vinnytsa the most part of people don't have their own car  teacher: and vinnytsa's got the famous fountains,2,2
45913,84,"student: yes  teacher: i see! it's probably better for the environment, to use public transport",3,3
45914,84,"student: i saw one of th why?  teacher: well, if everyone owns a car and drives around, there are more emissions per person than if everyone shares a bus or trolleybus! trolleybuses are very green",3,3
45915,84,"student: oh, i see  teacher: are there any trolleybuses?",1,2
45916,84,student: of couse course *  teacher: cool!,3,1
45917,84,"student: there are a lot of them we also use them  teacher: yes, they are supposed to be more green because they use electricity, not petrol",2,2
45918,84,"student: i like that idea  teacher: me too! i know you probably didn't have a chance to revise the new words from the last time, but i did prepare a little something to practise them for you!",4,3
45919,84,"student: that's okay  teacher: the words are debunk, deduce - deduction, exploration, abandon and evidence could you fill in the gaps, please?",3,2
45920,84,"student: okay  teacher: to ____ what happened that night, the police have to look at the ____: a fresh scratch on the car, a broken lock, some footprints on the carpet.",3,3
45921,84,"student: abandon and deduction ?  teacher: mmm, not quite",1,1
45922,84,"student: both are not okay, or the one?  teacher: first gap: understand something from looking at the facts none",2,2
45923,84,student: debunk?  teacher: nope!,1,1

45932,84,student: picture  teacher: glass!,2,2
45933,84,student: oh  teacher: magnifying glass,1,2
45934,84,"student: okay  teacher: a dictionary definition: a piece of curved glass that makes objects look bigger than they are ok, <student>, a little bit of homework for you. if you have a scroll through olia hercules' instagram account and find a recipe you particularly like, could you tell me about it next time? what ingredients are used and how it's made?",3,4
45935,84,student: okay  teacher: lovely! thursday 10 am?,3,1
45936,84,"student: yes goodbye!  teacher: lovely, have a good day!",3,1
45937,84,student: have a nice day too!  teacher: thanks :),3,0
45939,7,"teacher: hi there <student>, all ok?  student: hi <teacher>, how are you?",2,1
45940,7,"teacher: yeah i'm good thanks, just been for a run!  student: that's a great way to start the day. i also did some exercise this morning i have done, i guess",3,2
45941,7,teacher: yeah? what did you do? i'll come back on the have done or did in a bit it is more common overall to use the present perfect for e.g. this morning if it hasnt finished yet butits by no means a rule and e.g. did is perfectly fine especially if youre focusing on the action itself tell me about your exercise if you like!  student: every morning i try to do something. this morning i went for a walk and afterwards i did some yoga at home. i'd love to run but i can't. i have something like arthrosis so if i force myself too much i get pain everywhere...,3,3
45942,7,"teacher: ok i see ...too bad about the running...but yoga is good i guess...do you find it's good mentally too? i've never really done it to be honest ...i'm too impatient i think!  student: i understand. i thought the same before i did it the first time. it is actually very hard, people tent to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing but i think it is very good for your body. it is difficult to explain but the first time i went to a class i realised that if i don't do this kind of exercises (streching exercises mainly) i won't be able to do my shoes in 10 years haha stretching",3,4
45943,7,teacher: yes i realise it's not easy really! i can see it's really good for you particularly for as you get older(!) - actually i do lots of runnign so i do have to do a lot of e.g. core exercises and stuff some of which aren't dissimilar to yoga...  student: what does 'dissimilar' mean??,3,2
45944,7,"teacher: not similar to ...so not dissimilar means...similar!  student: ok, thanks",3,1
45945,7,teacher: it's bit of a complicated way of putting it i guess but common for educated speakers like me...(!)  student: i think running and yoga is a very good combination. an d when i say yoga i mean exercises that help you to stretch all your muscles,2,2
45946,7,teacher: yes i'm sure you're right...i have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? but i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after christmas! by the way <student> i noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??! do you know what i mean by'typo' (=a typing error)  student: kung fu?? that sounds fun!,3,1
45947,7,"teacher: yeah well my daughter started doing it and has really got into it so i thought i'd try do some extra with her - so i can defend myself against her!  student: oh no, it's a mistake. i thought the verb was to tent, i`ll correct it thanks",3,3
45948,7,teacher: ok sure - she hit me with her elbow the other day and it really hurt even though she's only 9  student: haha did she hit you by accident??,3,4
45949,7,"teacher: no! we were play fighting - but she takes it quite seriously hahah the tricky thing is as a parent i feel like i have to lose you know? but..at the same time i have to try to get her to cope with failure!  student: sure, i guess that is a difficult situation as a parent. i believe that it's not very helpful for children when parents let them win all the time but i'm not a mum",4,3
45950,7,"teacher: no i think you're right - i guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children i think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? compettive i mean competitive! learn the hard way = learn through bad experiences in case you weren't sure by the way  student: no, i've never played any sport as a team (i don't know how to say that)",3,2
45951,7,teacher: you can say 'as part of a team' or 'in a team' or 'team sport' - all with the verb play  student: great,3,1
45952,7,teacher: but not 'as a team' just for yourself!  student: i understand,2,1
45953,7,teacher: i sed to play a lot of football but then 'retired' cos of injuries and now i just run but actually i've really got into it and run races etc used to play  student: i wish i had but i wasn't interested in team sports when i was younger,3,3
45954,7,teacher: yeah some kids just don't - for different reasons i guess  student: running is very popular in spain at the moment,2,2
45955,7,teacher: yeah? in the uk too i'd say....there are lots of 'park runs' everywhere every saturday and people just turn up and do a 5k - i go to the athletics club so a bit more than average....  student: i think it's great! i can see much more people exercising on the streets nowadays than a few years ago,3,4
45956,7,"teacher: yes, you know one thing that i think about with running and spain is that it must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?) when i lived there i didn't do much exercise - just smoked and drank too much! i gave up smoking a long time ago by the way thank god...  student: yes, i think you are right. i'm not sure if runners keep running in summer time... i don't know if you know that in the canary islands it is generally 22 degrees all the year round (is it correct?) so we don't have that problem",3,3
45957,7,teacher: oh yes of course i forgot about that ...perfect! you can say: 'all year round' without 'the'  student: haha i see that your experience in spain wasn't to healthy but i guess it was very fun thanks for corrections,3,4
45958,7,teacher: it was fun yeah! nice food cheap fags and booze so at the time i loved it!  student: fags and booze?? i don't know these words,3,2
45959,7,teacher: yeah i guessed you might not - i sued them deliberately sorry...they're informal ways of saying cigarettes and alcohol (in that order)!  student: how long did you live in spain? (do i need to add 'for' at the end of the question?) haha fun words,3,3
45960,7,teacher: no you don't need to add 'for' i was there for 3 years (with a 12-month break in the middle in france)  student: woww 3 years is a lot,3,2
45961,7,teacher: by the way the fags one is more lower class than the booze one i'd say...  student: did you teach english all the time?,2,2
45962,7,teacher: yes i was still teaching it was 20 years or so ago now  student: i just looked up the word fag in the dictionary and the first meaning is 'gay in an offensive way' (i didn't know that meaning either). the second meaning is cigarettes.,3,3
45963,7,teacher: yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! i'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more american than british  student: i'm not sure about how to use 'look up'... can i say 'i look up fag in the dictionary...'??,3,2
45964,7,teacher: yes you were right! it was correct  student: ok thanks,3,0
45965,7,teacher: what else would you say?  student: about look up??,2,1
45966,7,teacher: yes  student: i looked up the sky and i saw...??,2,2
45967,7,"teacher: oh, yes of course ....no i meant for the meaning of look up something in the dictionary etc...but it's ok - that's exactly the phrasal verb you need - i just wanted to check you weren't using something else that was wrong sometimes  student: ahh i see i checked the word in the dictionary ??",3,3
45968,7,teacher: yes that's fine too - would you say 'search' ?  student: not sure. i don't say it but i don't know if it is right i search on the internet,3,2
45969,7,teacher: no that's good - just wanted to check - lots of non-natives use 'search' a lot now because of the internet of course - it's fine for that but they use it too much for other things you see - look up and check = perfect  student: ok,3,1
45970,7,"teacher: by the way do you use the internet much to keep up your english? e.g. youtube ..or netflix or something  student: yes, i try to watch things in english. i listen to bbc radio podcasts, ted talks, i watch series... my idea is to take the cambridge advanced exam in february so i have to work on it everyday... it's hard thoug +though",3,3
45971,7,"teacher: yeah that's great - there's so much now right? i've really noticed the effect on the average level of my students, especially the younger ones - they've picked up so much from the internet etc - that's great about cae - it's good to have a set goal i guess...  student: yes, the internet is great for that!",3,1
45972,7,teacher: sorry small thing <student> - earlier you said (i think) something like 'i also do a lot of exercise' - is there a difference in your mind between 'also' and e.g. too/as well'  student: what do you mean by 'a difference in your mind'? are you asking me if i know how to use them all??,2,3
45973,7,teacher: which one is more formal of the three?  student: i don't know!!,2,1
45974,7,teacher: also' is more formal - to the extent that it's a little bit weird to hear: 'i also...' in everyday sepaking. it's not a big deal! and something shared by probably about 99.9% of non-native speakers to be honest.....  student: really?? for me it doesn't sound formal at all.,3,3
45975,7,"teacher: it's more normal at the start of a sentence to introduce another point you see? like: i'm going because it's fun. also, i want to see my friends etc  student: i love learning this kind of things... i find it funny the way we understand a language when we studied it.",3,4
45976,7,"teacher: but the person answering wouldn't say: i also want to see my friends - they'd say (the native speaker!) : i want to see my friends too/as well... yes there's loads of littel things little  student: i understand, very interesting",3,2
45977,7,teacher: i'm sure you picked loads of authentic tuff from living in the uk well you have - i can see that picked up loads of stuff i meant!  student: sure!! by living there i realised how different it is learning a language at school in your own country from learning in the country (ohh i don't know how to say this) how different is to learn...,3,3
45978,7,"teacher: no that's fine! you were right the first time! ok thanks <student> i guess we'll stop there - i'll email you in a bit ok?  student: ok, thank your very much again good bye!",3,1
45980,27,teacher: hi <student> is that you?! yes sorry it's you <student's username>  student: ahahah yes easy one,2,2
45981,27,teacher: yes! ok <student> so....like we said i'll just ask you some part 3 style questions and you can answer as if you were speaking ok? try to say at least a couple of things about each quesrtion (e.g. a reason/example or whjatever) and i'll wait for you to finish...ok first question coming up  student: ok,3,1
45982,27,"teacher: ok so the topic is 'work' and question: is job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?'  student: i believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy, it would be difficult for you to be happy it's important to do a work that we can enjoy because it will be our main occupation during the day",3,3
45983,27,teacher: ok thanks <student>...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean  student: that's the reason why after the hight school it would be better to make a councious (i know thespelling is wrong) decision you mean for example subject?,3,2
45984,27,teacher: ok thanks so good more normal here) ...hold on...  student: i see,1,1
45985,27,teacher: well an ecample of a job with the features you mention - high salary but (perhaps not enjoyable...  student: ah ok,3,1
45986,27,teacher: because it gives you a chance to use more detailed language you see  student: for example a business man had a lot of responsabilities but it's depend from the people depends,3,2
45987,27,teacher: and it's not enjoyable as a result? because it's...? stressful for example?  student: for some people being a doctor can be not enjoyable because life of young people and adults depend from him lifes,3,2
45988,27,"teacher: ok thanks some specific examples often good idea - hold on a sec <student>, look at following and make a change if you can: you said: i believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy... are the two verb tenses ok here? by the way: spelling good for plural  student: the plural of life is lives??",3,3
45989,27,teacher: yes!  student: english people=creazy ahahah,1,2
45990,27,teacher: :)  student: i'm joking,1,1
45991,27,teacher: well you might be right!  student: we don't know ah but are you waitlist ting for me? waiting,3,2
45992,27,teacher: er yes sorry ...for the verb tense question...and depend 'from' ?  student: sorry depend by,2,1
45993,27,teacher: no worrries! on on on on on on on on !!!  student: ahahahha,1,3
45994,27,teacher: sorry unnecessary  student: i'm really bad with preposition,2,2
45995,27,teacher: and yes before you ask - always  student: ahahaha,4,3
45996,27,teacher: well it's not only you so don't be hard on yourself!  student: i was writing the question for this answer no it's the realty,2,1
45997,27,teacher: ha i can imagine  student: english people are too lucky troppo,1,2
45998,27,teacher: you mean 'very' right?!  student: maybe... ahaha yes i mean 'too' in an italian way,3,2
45999,27,teacher: yes we can never be sure....ok <student> you used 'had' and don't enjoy' - is this ok in one conditional sentence?  student: it's depends on what comes after or before the past with would the present with will,3,1
46000,27,teacher: well no not really because you can't switch between 1st and 2nd because it's either real or not real you see  student: ahhh sure,2,0
46001,27,teacher: so if you say 'had' you have to follow it with ...? don't or didn't?  student: didn't,3,1
46002,27,teacher: ok good! you can switch between 2nd and 3rd because this is about time you see?  student: and then i must use would,3,2
46003,27,teacher: yes exactly  student: i see when i can use the mixed one?,2,3
46004,27,teacher: ok next question if you're ready: whcat skills are need to get a good job these days? ah hold on are needed' sorry hold on hold on  student: leadership,2,2
46005,27,teacher: well for example: i would be rich (now so 2nd) if i had studied medicine (in the past so 3rd) ok?  student: can i say 'if i studied medicine i would be rich'? i never understand the difference,3,3
46006,27,"teacher: if you mean you 're imagining beginning to study medicine now then yes the if i had studied = i didn't study it but if i had .....(often a regret you know?) you understand 'regret' right ? like i wish i had/hadn't but i didn't  student: ah so if i'm a babysitter and i had already done the main decision of my life i have to use the 3rd, right? yes regret",3,3
46007,27,teacher: yes exactly...so i wish i wasn't a babysitter (now) i wish i had studied medicine or whatever in the past  student: because i can't change the things now,3,2
46008,27,teacher: yes exactly!  student: ahhhhh thanks,3,1
46009,27,teacher: so 3rd = unreal past and 2nd = unreal present/future  student: thanks a lot,2,1
46010,27,teacher: ok no problem - <student> keep going with the skills if you're ready the skills question i mean  student: yes i am,3,1
46011,27,teacher: ok... you ok? you mentioned 'leadership'....? sorry if you're typing i'll wait...  student: according to me one of the most significant skills to get a job is leadership because without this one it's impossible to.... i dont know how explain in italian neither do not be submissive?,3,2
46012,27,teacher: ha! well i guess that 'leadership skills' are only really essential in some jobs right ?  student: it's not the exactly word,3,1
46013,27,teacher: um...you mean self-confidence maybe?  student: i think in the majority of them yes good idea,3,2
46014,27,teacher: yes i think this makes more sense (certainly to my english brain) a common idea (and good)  student: in my italian brain too,3,3
46015,27,teacher: maybe more of a quality than a skills but don't worry too much! ok any other ideas?  student: let me think,3,1
46016,27,teacher: ok...i'll wait!  student: another remarkable ability could be having knowledge about a specific area of study,3,3
46017,27,teacher: ok....when you say 'remarkable' you mean...?  student: important,2,2
46018,27,teacher: ah ok - that's better or e.g. valuable maybe? so 'specialist knowledge' = good phrase here ok?  student: yes,3,2
46019,27,teacher: always good to give specific example if possible so...can you think of a particular area?  student: for example a person graduated in economy will have more chance to be hired than another person without a degree in a specific company,3,3
46020,27,teacher: ok thanks so...a candidate for a job with a degree in economics will have more chance of being hired than... fine or e.g. more likely to be hired = also possible  student: so good so better,3,2
46021,27,teacher: thanks! ok <student> we'll have to stop in a minute but...good skills to mention might include e.g. communication skills/it skills etc  student: yes,3,1
46022,27,teacher: because they're related to the world of work nowadays do you see?  student: languages yes i see,3,2
46023,27,teacher: yes good example! give me a sentence with that one if you like  student: which one,3,1
46024,27,teacher: languages... cos it was your idea!  student: it's also important to develop languages skills to improve the communication with other agencies and colleagues,3,3
46025,27,teacher: ok thanks! 'colleagues'/'develop skills' 'important to' = all good! not 'the' though  student: yes sorry,3,2
46026,27,teacher: that's ok! we'll call it a day i guess thanks <student> see you tomorrow....  student: thank youuu,3,1
46028,70,"student: good afternoon <teacher>.  teacher: hi there <student>, how's it going?",3,3
46029,70,"student: yes... i just feel tired when when want to study massive new knowledge. it is difficult to see improvement of myself. because they all hard for me,.  teacher: ok...you mean you feel overwhelmed by the huge task in front of you? you mean improving your english? or other things? python??!",3,2
46030,70,"student: yes... including improving my english. i also spend a long time for each new knowledge that over-break my abilities.  teacher: yes i see,,,it can seem very hard i know... it is a long process...you've just got to keep going step by step and have faith that you are improving (you are!) and try to enjoy the process don't think about a 'finish line'",3,3
46031,70,student: yes...i really enjoy the whole process when i am studying new knowledge. but sometime i feel unhappy.  teacher: yes...can you set yourself small achievable goals?,3,2
46032,70,student: because i also forget many knowledge.  teacher: the problem sometimes is that you have no way to measure your progress you see?,3,1
46033,70,"student: yes.. i thinks so, i just keep studying...  teacher: yes, well you won't remember everything the first time you know? you have to lean something many times before you really remember it - that's normal yuu had to do that at the beginning too - you've just forgotten",3,2
46034,70,"student: i perceive it is may a long process.  teacher: also, remember <student> that memorising words and then trying to 'test' your memory is not easy - what really matters is that you can use the language you're studying you know? but for example, the changes you made to your use of tenses last week was a big step",3,3
46035,70,student: thanks for youencourage me  teacher: it might not feel that way but any english speaker reading/listening to your correct present perfect/past simple or going to/will examples would notice a big difference ok fine!,3,2
46036,70,student: thanks very much.  teacher: ok <student> - let's have a quick practice of past/future ok? tell me 5 things you did at the weekend if you can ok?,3,3
46037,70,"student: yes, after we finished class, i reviewed the stuffs which i studied in class, and on saturday, i watched the videos that are 'coursera' curriculums, and on sunday i made next week's studying plans, everything seems like on the correct track. however, in the morning when i watched videos of coursers i also felt unhappy, because they are hard to understood whatever in listening or reading, and after today's class i am going to review those videos again. actually, i really think that doing something new at the beginning is really difficult.  teacher: ok thanks <student> for all that ... hold on asec",3,2
46038,70,"student: seemed like - i forgot to use past simple here.  teacher: yes ok got it! yes so...correct past simple verbs here and also a nice 'going to' for plans = great! so now i think i understand a bit more why you feel a bit down about your english! you have to remember <student> that the videos on coursera are not designed for non-natives - they would be hard for most students also, you an't expect to understand everything...did you understand the main idea in the videos? can't expect i mean",4,3
46039,70,student: yes.. and another thing i am unhappy is that our class ending on wednesday.  teacher: yes i can understand that - it was quite a routine i can imagine...,3,2
46040,70,"student: yes.. for example, the video required me finish the task on 20 minutes, but it also takes me 1 or 2 hours to understand. required me to  teacher: ok i see ... that is quite ambitious - perhaps you should try something a bit easier?",3,3
46041,70,"student: but.. until now, i really fell my english have been have improving while i am studying with you, i really enjoy the time that i am studying online with you. have been improved  teacher: feel has been improving also possible",4,2
46042,70,student: haha.... i am not sure why i repeated the sentences.....  teacher: that's ok - important thing is it's not past simple ok <student> - shall we try a completely new topic to just get going and forget about these problems,3,3
46043,70,student: yes.. i am ready.  teacher: ok ... i've just made some material on the topic of space (spending on space exploration ) ... why don't you tell me some words that you think might be useful to include in an essay on this topic? give me three to start if you can ok? anything that comes to mind!,3,4
46044,70,student: one of the most .... another reason why....is that advantageous and disadvantageous effects obviously for instance  teacher: ok thanks <student>... so these phrase could definitely be useful in a lot of different essays that's true.....hold on.... these phrases,3,2
46045,70,student: ok in my opinion  teacher: ok let me use one of your phrases and ask you to finish it ok? 'another reason why we should spend money on space exploration is that...' a quick idea if possible!,3,4
46046,70,student: ......is that human is not isolation in space. i am sure.. not sure  teacher: ok thanks ... 'isolation' = nice word.... you mean that there is life on other planets?,4,3
46047,70,student: yes  teacher: ok undestood! so can you change your sentence to show that this just a possibility?,3,2
46048,70,student: human want to spend millions on search of aline life.  teacher: ok thanks ... 'spend millions on searching for alien life' = good sentence yes! do you think this is a good idea? do you think we should spend this money?,3,3
46049,70,"student: yes, i agree with it. because it can make human aware we are not alone wise specie in space.  teacher: ok so .... going back to the idea that you say you are not sure there is life on other planets.... do you remember talking about rolling the dice and getting a double six? this is 'unl_ _ _ _ _ _ '??",3,2
46050,70,student: unlikely unlikely  teacher: ok well remembered! so you think that it is __________ that alien life exists.?,3,2
46051,70,student: it is likely that alien life exists.  teacher: ok great ... so a good topic sentence could be: 'one reason why i think we should spend money on space exploration is that it is likely that alien life exists.' ok?,3,3
46052,70,"student: yes, it is more clearly.  teacher: ok ... what could you say in a paragraph like this? i mean, why is it good to find alien life? remeember the stupid person? the stupid person would say: ok fine maybe there is life but so what? why should i pay tax to try to find it??",3,2
46053,70,"student: because we can move our attention from money to another things, such as arts since arts and sience. science  teacher: you mean as a result of finding alien life?",3,3
46054,70,student: which have values can show to alien.  teacher: ok so you mean finding alien life would inspire us to change our behaviour? ok i see what you mean...,3,2
46055,70,"student: yes,, i think if we just focus on money or daily problems, we may become more materialism.  teacher: materialistic = the adjective you need here (good word)",3,1
46056,70,student: yes... i think it is a strange idea...  teacher: are there any arguments in favour of spending money on space exploration which might be easier to explain?,3,2
46057,70,student: i think if i disagree with this idea is more easily to explain.  teacher: oh sorry <student> - can you hold that though t and tell me after the break ok? ok i see your point there...we'l c ome back to it ok? bye for now..,3,1
46058,70,"student: yes,, see you  teacher: ok!",1,0
46060,221,student: hi <teacher>!  teacher: hi <student>!,1,1
46061,221,"student: how are you?  teacher: how are you? all good, thank you!",2,1
46062,221,"student: i am good thank you :. finally i can go back to the office from time to time! i guess 'i can finally go back...' would have been a better word-ordering...anyway everything is good  teacher: oh really? oh yes, i remember, you mentioned it last time! have you been yet? do you have to wear a mask and take precautions?",3,3
46063,221,"student: except for the pandemic...  teacher: yes, i can finally go back does sound better!",3,1
46064,221,"student: i am there currently...i have to be tested every second day, wear an ffp2 mask in the common areas... but it is a nice change, from time to time  teacher: right, i see! i can imagine. does it mean things are looking up in austria in terms of corona?",3,3
46065,221,"student: hmm, i am not sure about the meaning of the expression 'things are looking up'...if it means that cases are increasing...you are right. germany has already started a strong lockdown, i believe austria will follow suit if things go on like this...  teacher: oh no, the opposite. if things are looking up, the situation is improving. i'm sorry to hear this is not the case! oh no, that's bad news! very sorry to hear that! today's the anniversary of the first lockdown in the uk",3,4
46066,221,"student: i see...austria and italy both went in lockdown earlier about a week ago...  teacher: yes, i've read about the third wave in italy... awful!",3,2
46067,221,"student: hmm, no, i guess more than a week ago, but i can't remember exactly when...unfortunately vaccinations are not going as initially planned there are few doses and politicians mishandled the vaccine situation when blocking astrazeneca .if you ask me.... now a lot of people do not trust it anymore...the press has its share of fault too, unfortunately...  teacher: yes, that was my impression too. it all got really political .probably reflecting a worsened relationship with the uk.. but astrazeneca is a tried and tested vaccine, and people suffer as a result of this row oh, i see! yes, this is really bad! trust is everything",3,3
46068,221,"student: last week our childminder was supposed to get jabbed, but had a last minute panic attack and decided to renounce taking it...  teacher: right, i see. it's the worst!",2,1
46069,221,"student: she has a difficult situation in her family, so we were sort of expecting this, but still it tells about the responsability of the press and politics...  teacher: yes, definitely! such a shame though. they'll have to work hard to get back on track!",3,2
46070,221,"student: yes, but it will take years for the public to rebuild the trust towards vaccines... indeed...anyhow, i see you sent me a pdf...before the lesson i have also done the last exercise of the paper  teacher: you know what, 'to get jabbed' sounds like she was about to be punched. 'to get the jab' would be better here",3,1
46071,221,"student: oh, i see..that is quite a difference indeed... she was going to get the jab...  teacher: oh lovely, let me get my answer key for the reading, feel free to type your answers here yes, a subtle difference! ready when you are!",3,3
46072,221,"student: i am not too sure about all of them... 44 d,b 45 e, 46 c, 47 b, 48 a, 49 e, 50 b, 51 d, 52 a, 53 a,c but i tried to look for 'sentences which directly connect to the paragraph'...unfortunately i didn't print the paper so i couldn't underline them  teacher: yes, this is the right approach! what about 44 and 53? are you not sure which one fits better?",3,3
46073,221,"student: oh, i misread the assignment: i believed a line could be assigned to multiple paragraphs too which greatly increased my uncertainty about the overall result i woudl go with 44 b  teacher: ah, this is sometimes the case .two answers to one question., but then there would have been two numbers for example, in which paragraph does the author express his disappointment in his friend 55. 56.",3,2
46074,221,"student: i see...actually for the 53 i am unsure, a  teacher: and you could answer in either order, not necessarily alphabetically ok, why is 44 b then?",3,1
46075,221,"student: when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.  teacher: aha, i see. this is in the past though, and the question is about the possibility that photography can influence events in the world .at present.",3,2
46076,221,"student: i see, while the first sentence of d is indeed describing the possibility of change in the current time whether photography possesses the voice and power to instigate social change.  teacher: exactly! 44. d then :. what about 53? why did you choose a?",3,1
46077,221,"student: i was going to answer with the sentence: ' the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of capturing the essence of our being alive.' but this justifies 52 a... so i believe i chose the wrong paragraph  teacher: yes, this is exactly right :. your other idea was c, do you think that one holds water?",3,3
46078,221,"student: yes, its second sentence is quite explicit about this: 'it was seen not only as the culmination of visual representation...'  teacher: absolutely!",2,2
46079,221,"student: i guess it really is easier to do these exercises with pen and paper...  teacher: everything else is correct, just those two that you were unsure about",3,1
46080,221,"student: great!  teacher: yes, i believe so! if you do take the exam one day, you might have a choice of paper-based or computer-based format, depending on the exam centre",3,2
46081,221,"student: i will make sure to ask beforehand about this possibility  teacher: and it's a bit awkward to be switching between windows here all the time, but i really wanted to give you a taste of what the exam is like mind you, the computer-based format should be equally convenient. for once, you won't have a pdf, it will all be in one program",2,3
46082,221,"student: i see :. well, i will think about it...for now i would say that i need to study a bit, but i could definitely do the exam :.  teacher: well, there's probably no urgency for you, is there? but it's a nice way to motivate oneself if necessary ok, before we move on i'll just say that i'll take two weeks off teaching because my son will be home for easter holidays. i can offer you the next class on tuesday april 13 if the time is still good for you",3,2
46083,221,"student: no, indeed, but it is nice to see that it is something i could definitely do well, after some studying and with some tips on how to do the different exercises yes, that is okay with me :.  teacher: yes, exactly! lovely! have you got any nice plans for the less-than-ideal easter? are you going to make something nice?",3,3
46084,221,"student: if the weather is good i will hire an easter bunny... meaning i will hide some chocolates in the garden, the kids love it :.  teacher: ooh, yes, the egg hunt! it's a must here :.",3,3
46085,221,"student: but i don't think we will do much more...we might go to vienna this weekend for the palm's sunday, but i don't know...the covid situation is really precarious what about you? will you do some travelling for easter?  teacher: it sounds like you are where we were in january :. we're so used to being locked down now, no one's enterntaining any thoughts of going anywhere...",3,2
46086,221,"student: .maybe the correct way to write it 'we will go to vienna for palm sunday? i am really unsure here.  teacher: well, the only thing we'll be able to do is go for a drive, to the seaside or the forest or one of the beautiful gardens yes, i think it's palm sunday, no article!",3,3
46087,221,"student: that's already a nice idea :. hopefully we will do that too during easter...but i am deliberately keeping my vacation for later on, in the hope of going to italy :.  teacher: wait, what did you mean? the verb? will / might? yes, i can imagine, save your holidays! or vacations, in american english",3,2
46088,221,"student: .no it was about the article...i changed the verb because it was easier to type.... you are right, my holidays...  teacher: sure. might is a very good verb there :. no, it's good either way! nothing wrong with american words :.",3,2
46089,221,"student: unfortunately the italian word for holidays is 'vacation', so this is a typical mistake that english teachers in italy will correct...  teacher: ah yes, of course it is!",2,1
46090,221,"student: sorry, the italian word is 'vacanza', not vacation ;.  teacher: sure ok, let's have a quick look at the writing paper i sent you, ok? let's focus on part 2 at the moment. .it's got 2 parts, 90 minutes to write both tasks. it's page 4 in the pdf",2,2
46091,221,"student: okay, i am there :. i have a question: in order to write number 5 i need to have read the book, is that correct?  teacher: great! the task is set for you in part 1, but you have a choice out of a few options in part 2. could you have a quick look and tell me which one looks most appealing to you? and which one would be best to write about .in terms of showing off good language. yes, that's right! in fact, not only do you need to have read the book, but you also need to have a relatively fresh memory of it, to know how to spell names of characters etc. which is why the book review task is a very rare choice among candidates and exam teachers :.",3,3
46092,221,"student: therefore number 5 is out of question in this case .i actually have the book 'girl with a pearl earring', but in the last years i am piling up some books because i have less time to read....  teacher: yes, i can relate to that!",3,2
46093,221,"student: i believe the easiest would be number 4...  teacher: i haven't read either of them, unfortunately yes, number 4 is a good choice!",2,1
46094,221,"student: to do well on the other examples i woudl need some language knowledge of specific fields, e.g. architecture, which i don't really have  teacher: i'll just say here that you can pick an imaginary as well as a real situation in your life. some people find it easier to write about imaginary situations, and vice versa",3,3
46095,221,"student: i think i have the best real-life example ;. should i write the letter here?  teacher: well, if you are describing a building, again, no one is looking for historical accuracy or the correct identification of an architectural style",3,2
46096,221,"student: sentence by sentence, and you'll comment along the way?  teacher: hold on, one second!",2,1
46097,221,"student: okay! i have also noticed it is already 13:52  teacher: for example, i was doing the 'desribing the building' task with my other c2 student, and she was describing a famous museum. she went, 'it was built in 1898'. true historically, but pretty much worthless in terms of earning language proficiency points!",3,3
46098,221,"student: i see... i need to use complex words, and show my proficiency... but it is difficult to do that while stating the date of something being built...  teacher: yes, exactly! one second, just looking for a good example but in case of 'an important decision in your life', you can think in terms of third conditionals .if i had not done that, this and that would not have happened. inversions .always for c2. little did i know... etc. and of course, nice complex words! oh yes, and, as you have seen, it's a letter, so you'll need to start with 'dear sir or madam.'",3,4
46099,221,"student: okay, then i'll do that as a homework... :.  teacher: sorry about a rushed introduction. would you like to write it as homework over the break? if not, we can always do it sentence by sentence next time oh yes, sorry, i've just seen your reply. great!",3,2
46100,221,"student: i think it is better if i try to do it alone, thinking a bit about what i am writing.  teacher: and the word count is important, too!",2,1
46101,221,"student: no problem :. then enjoy your holidays! .okay, i'll keep track of that.  teacher: sure! i",3,1
46102,221,"student: bye!!  teacher: lovely, you too, have a lovely time, speak to you soon!",4,2
46949,167,student: hi  teacher: hi <student>! how are you today?,3,2

46953,167,"student: festive?  teacher: yes, festival adjective good question! the season of festivals (xmas and new year) = the festive season",3,3
46954,167,"student: oh  teacher: in this culture, obviously. in different countries there will be different festive seasons yes, you can also say 'a festive mood / spirit' festive decorations festive food things like that festive, the stress is on the first syllable when is the start of your school holidays?",3,4
46955,167,"student: on 25th  teacher: oh, i see, it's sooner here, the 18th we'll stop with our chats for the holiday, actually, but we can talk about it on friday are you looking forward to your holiday?",3,3

46959,167,"student: not really my closest friends no  teacher: ok, sure oh, did you see how i used a phrasal verb from last time there? i've sorted out all christmas presents",3,3
46960,167,"student: yes  teacher: yes, = i've solved that problem, i've done this task ok, a quick exercise to practise the phrasal verbs from the last time. i'll give you sentences in which a preposition is missing from the phrasal verb. can you fill the preposition? she was obviously lying. shed made ___ a story about how she met lady gaga after the concert and gone to a party with her.",4,4

46970,167,"student: out  teacher: yes, very well done! :) so, we've got: make up (a story); get over something; go on; cheer up; hang out with; get on (well) with; bump into; cheat on break up and sort out which one means 'to recover from something' (emotional upset / an illness)?",3,2
46971,167,"student: get over  teacher: yes, good! now you give me a definition, please, and i'll try and guess the phrasal verb",3,3

46980,167,"student: yes  teacher: ok, and finally, to invent (a story)?",3,2
46981,167,"student: make up  teacher: yes :) if you're having a bad day, what cheers you up?",3,3
46982,167,"student: coming at home and just chill out  teacher: aww, good! another phrasal verb :) by the way, another meaning of 'cheat' is to do something to get an unfair advantage for example, if, during a test at school, a student keeps secretly looking at their notes, they are cheating on a test",3,2
46983,167,"student: yes i know  teacher: great :) do people still cheat on tests at school, like when i was young?",3,3
46984,167,student: of course  teacher: oh really? how do they do it?,3,4
46985,167,"student: i also do that sometimes  teacher: haha, what's your favourite method?",3,4
46986,167,"student: i like to ask my bf from another class to give me answers  teacher: ooh, naughty! are their any specific subjects where you cheat and where you don't?",3,3
46987,167,student: last year it was biology  teacher: did you cheat there or not then?,1,2
46988,167,"student: while it was lockdown i just askef my bf for answers and yesterday it was chemistry  teacher: oh, i remember you said, it used to be easy to cheat because you could use the books! are there subjects where you never cheat?",3,3
46989,167,student: but yesterday we gave our phones to our teacher so i wrote everything by myself so i could only just to check the answers they were correct  teacher: oh good! you would have been correct anyway :) so are there any subjects where you never cheat?,3,2
46990,167,student: and it was easy to cheat on history o don't cheat on math because like it doesn't even make any sense ypu just need to know how to make it  teacher: you just need to know how to solve a math ____ what's the word for a task in math?,3,3
46991,167,student: sorry i forgot i understand  teacher: a math problem,1,1
46992,167,"student: yesss  teacher: yes :)) ok, let's throw in some old words! i'm sure you're excited :) what does 'annual' mean?",3,3
46993,167,"student: every year  teacher: yes, good! what about equality'? it's a human right, remember?",3,3
46994,167,"student: mmm  teacher: ok, i'll give you a hint two plus two equals 4",2,1
46995,167,"student: yeah  teacher: if men and women have the same rights and opportunities, they are equal",3,3
46996,167,"student: i understand  teacher: they are not the same, but they are equal equality is the right of different people to have a similar social position and to be treated the same remember we talked about it?",3,2
46997,167,"student: yeah  teacher: ok, lovely! i'll let you go and chill :)",3,1

47002,153,student: our class teacher is ill so onthebreak in our class it is chaos  teacher: i see! there's no one to look after you guys?,3,2
47003,153,student: and today one boy spilled some juice on my head and on my friend's jacket  teacher: oh goodness! that's not very good!,3,3
47004,153,student: just to have fun i finally washed my hair my mom is going to call his parents and another boy ma made a hole the top of the room-? i don't know the word  teacher: in the roof? the ceiling? how did he do that?,3,4
47005,153,"student: yes he threw the bottle and the ceiling is easy to brake so there was a hole  teacher: wow, yes, your class is indeed in a bit of a chaos! haven't you got a substitute teacher?",3,4
47006,153,student: and they somehow spilled yoghurt on the ceiling if it is class teacher than no  teacher: i see! i hope your teacher will be back soon!,2,2
47007,153,"student: if it is a lesson, then we have the substitute teacher  teacher: have you got any nice plans for the weekend?",2,3
47008,153,student: no  teacher: no? not even to have a lie-in?,3,2
47009,153,"student: lie-in?  teacher: yes, when you sleep later than usual in the morning, you have a lie-in",3,3
47010,153,"student: it is a weekend tradition  teacher: yes :) i used to like getting up late, but now i like getting up early-ish at the weekend because then i have a whole day in front of me i've changed! despite the fact that people say, 'a leopard ____ ____ ____ ___'",3,4
47011,153,"student: can't change it spots  teacher: yes, well done! what about you? do you like getting up early?",2,3
47012,153,"student: no never  teacher: :)))) ok, have you had a chance to write a story about the fact that every cloud has a silver lining?",3,4
47013,153,"student: yes in every bad situation we should try to find smth good. it will always help us. when you feel sad , try to find something nice about that or make smth nice to you)  teacher: ok, that's good advice, thank you! do you manage to practise this?",3,3
47014,153,"student: what do you mean  teacher: i mean, do you try to find something good in each situation?",3,2
47015,153,"student: no i don't think so  teacher: ok, go on",1,1
47016,153,"student: it helps to a lot of people without to*  teacher: yes, good correction, i was just typing that :)",3,2
47017,153,"student: but not for me  teacher: i actually agree with you! i think, if something really bad happens, it's much healthier to be properly sad about it than to try and look for a silver lining oh, how is your business?",3,4
47018,153,"student: we want to make black friday at our shop  teacher: oooh, nice! it's today, right? black friday",3,3
47019,153,"student: yeah  teacher: let's revise our business words! if you cover your costs and earn extra money, you.....",3,4
47020,153,student: um(  teacher: make a .... profit,2,2
47021,153,"student: yes  teacher: and if you don't cover your costs, you .....",3,1
47022,153,"student: make a lost  teacher: nearly, make a loss",2,2
47023,153,"student: typo!!!  teacher: and if you don't make either a profit or a loss and just cover your costs, you break .... ok)",3,3
47024,153,"student: through oy  teacher: nope, you break even))",1,2
47025,153,"student: even yeaj  teacher: yes, you remember)",2,3
47026,153,student: you were first )  teacher: and all the money you earn is r......,2,2
47027,153,"student: revenue  teacher: yes, well done! you remember the difficult word)) ok, now something i've prepared for today! what kind of music do you like, <student>?",3,4
47028,153,"student: oh some pop but smth like 'baby baby baby oj our hjooj oy oooh or some indie-rock  teacher: ok, i think i got the idea))) do you like something like it? ok! what about hip hop?",3,3
47029,153,student: i don't know the typed *types  teacher: that's ok,2,1
47030,153,student: just music)  teacher: ok! i've found a piece on the bbc about this superstar rapper from namibia you know 'a rapper'?,3,2
47031,153,student: of course  teacher: sure)) but can you guess her day job? she is a rapper and also a ....,3,3
47032,153,student: teacher?)  teacher: no!,1,1
47033,153,"student: hmmm  teacher: well, no worries, you'll find out in a minute! just a few words before you watch it a teacher, a doctor, a postman - all these people do essential jobs, they can't work from home and they keep working even during a pandemic / lockdown in the uk, they are called 'key workers' people who do very important work that keeps us all going can you think of any other examples of key workers?",4,4
47034,153,"student: security  teacher: yes, sure ok! some key workers like doctors have to work 24/7, but, of course, one person can't do it, so they take turns some work in the morning, some at night these different times when people work are called 'shifts' people can work a night shift (work at night) or work a 24-hour shift or work double shifts, two together do you know anyone who works shifts?",3,3
47035,153,"student: hm security )))  teacher: yes, definitely)) firefighters, nursers, doctors, supermarket staff etc., right? ok! and after their hard work they need to come home and start to relax and a good word for it is 'unwind' /nwand/ unwind after a long day some people have a bath and a cup of tea to unwind some play some music i like to read a book and dance to unwind what about you?",4,4
47036,153,"student: i love playing minecraft with my friend every friday i play with her it is my way to unwind  teacher: great! ok, i'm going to send you the video about the rapper! oh, one second, i forgot that we need skype for that please watch and tell me, what her profession is and what you find interesting about her there it is!",2,3
47037,153,"student: she is a doctor and her way to unwind is making music  teacher: yes, definitely! and it's more than just a hobby, right? she is actually super successful!",3,3
47038,153,student: yes  teacher: do you think this story about her was recorded a long time ago? or about now?,3,1
47039,153,student: i think it is about now  teacher: why do you think so?,2,2
47040,153,"student: making music it ia her hobby  teacher: ok, but why do you think the story is about now?",2,3
47041,153,"student: i think every person who is making music now , will always feel music in his or her heart  teacher: oh yes, that's true! what i was talking about is that as a doctor she talks about he coronavirus pandemic, right? so it's got to be 2020!",1,4
47042,153,"student: maybe the topic is that no matter who you arr and whatever your job is, you can have a hobby that doesn't depend on your job  teacher: yes, that's a good idea to take from this!",4,2
47043,153,"student: right  teacher: ok, <student>, thank you, i'll let you go unwind and play minecraft with your friend!",3,1
47044,153,"student: thanks goodbye  teacher: have a lovely weekend, bye!",4,0
47045,153,student: have a nice weekend  teacher: thanks) thanks),1,0
47047,28,student: hi <teacher> still there??  teacher: hi yes i'm here <student> - really sorry for delay...,3,2
47048,28,"student: no worries, at the moment i have a lot of free time hehe  teacher: yes i guess so...is the 'c' word something we should mention or do you want to avoid it completely?!",3,3
47049,28,student: i'm ok with the 'c' word ;)  teacher: ok well....can i ask - are you allowed to g o out at the moment?,3,2
47050,28,"student: how are you in england? i haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you?  teacher: yes more or less - but the current advice is to avoid social contact so things are slowing down fast...many entertainment venues are closing for example it's only a matter of time before more places are forced to shut down i think....",3,3
47051,28,"student: we are allowed to go out to the supermarket, pharmacy or to your work place. there is police stopping people and asking where they are going... it's very wired :(  teacher: wow yeah that's pretty heavy - as i say that's definitely on the horizon here sooner rather than later... although weirdly the schools are sti;l open!",3,2
47052,28,student: i don't understand why they keep the schools open having the experiences of italy and now spain there are so many new cases every day... it's scary  teacher: yeah i think the rationale is that: stop key workers from having childcare commitments/prevent vulnerable grandparents from being exposed through providing childcare yes i guess that the vast majority of young(ish) people are relatively safe in the event of contracting the illness right...but of course it's very worrying for older people,3,3
47053,28,"student: yes, here we had that situation at the beginning when they closed the schools but parents kept working... now most of parents are working from home so they can look after their children and leave grandparents alone  teacher: yes i see...intersting that they expect parents to be able to look after kids and work at the same time! the situation at our school is pretty catastrophic to be honest...perhaps the end!",4,2
47054,28,"student: yessss, impossible for a lot of parents... specially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. my nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine?  teacher: yes - that's a tough change to make for everyone! i'll be in the same boat in a couple of weeks i'm sure... although i'll be effectively unemployed in fact from next week probably",4,1
47055,28,student: ohh really bad the news about your school... i guess there are not students travelling from their countries at the moment?  teacher: yes that's right and the vast majority who were here have left early while they can still get flights i'll have to scratch around getting any online work i can,2,1
47056,28,"student: it's going to be very difficult if the situation doesn't change very soon  teacher: yes, like lots of businesses the school can't survive more than a few months without income not with the overheads",3,1
47057,28,"student: i thought of online teaching, you can always do that. but if people can't work they don't have money to pay online classes... uffff hard  teacher: so all the staff will probably be laid off yes that's true i guess - that's what everyone's doing but as you say the demand won't necessarily be there right now - we'l see! i'm planning lots of quality time at my allotment...",3,2
47058,28,student: that sounds like a very good plan here you couldn't go to your allotment either!  teacher: that's definitely over the top! i think that would never happen in the uk! i've decided that allotments are quintessentially british - i.e. kind of shared/communnal but not really the perfect liberal compromise i mean controlled social spaces you know?,3,3
47059,28,"student: sorry, i don't understand what you mean... quintessentially??  teacher: oh right....like the perfect example of seomthing as in allotments are a perfect example of britishness or embody typical british values or whatever",3,2
47060,28,student: ahh i see  teacher: as in they provoke the feeling you should be sociable with your allotment 'neighbours' but there's no demand for you to be 'friends'! you can maintain privacy/distance that's why british people like board games so much e.g. shared activity but with clear rules so that everything's under control! (maybe - just a theory - not an original one),3,3
47061,28,"student: i understand, and i see here there are a lot of places where we could be with people keeping the 2 meters distance that doctors recommend but we can't go anywhere... same in italy haha i like the board games example  teacher: ok you mean (?) you should be able to go out as long as you stay 2 metres away from people as in: why don't they let us?",3,2
47062,28,student: that is what we have to do when we go to the supermarket or to the pharmacy  teacher: yes right - that must be strange - especially in spain/italy where you have less personal space - in the uk 2 metres is almost normal anyway! there are lots of jokes in the media at the moment about that sort of thing i.e. it's the perfect excuse for british people to feel less guilty about being...british! i.e. reserved etc,3,3
47063,28,"student: but for example, there is a big avenue in front of my house where i could walk without getting too close to people but there is a police officer walking around (not all the time) asking people where they are going... if you go to the supermarket they ask you for the receipt... it's crazy! i go to the supermarket everyday to buy something so that i have some fresh air at list for half an hour  teacher: wow - so if you live in a flat (do you?) you basically can't be outside at all really?",4,2
47064,28,student: here there are soooo many jokes about everything... it's great because at least we laugh quite often...  teacher: yes you've got to laugh or...(you know the ending right?),3,3
47065,28,"student: yes!!! i'm not suppose to leave at all. i'm very lucky, i can see the sea from my sofa and i live alone but i'm very sorry for families who live in a small flat with little children noooo, i don't know the ending! please, tell me...  teacher: ..or you'd cry! not really funny or clever - just wondered if you knew! often we don't bother saying the second part like lots of idioms... yes really tough as you say for people with toddlers etc i live in the middle of nowhere so i guess nobody can stop me from going for a walk where i am....",2,2
47066,28,student: haha we have something similar! 'me ro por no llorar'  teacher: ok nice - thanks! exactly the same really...,2,1
47067,28,student: you are very lucky there in the middle of nowhere  teacher: ya gotta laugh' is if you can imagine the quick spoken form of the phrase... hey <student> do you read phonemic script by the way? as in you'd follow this right?: /jg(t)lf/,3,2
47068,28,"student: what is being very nice is that there are a lot of free stuff available online, specially on instagram. there are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, yoga classes... everything to keep us doing something!! i have a diary to be able to remember all the activities i'd like to do ;) sorry, i go back to your question  teacher: yes that's great - i guess we're luck to have the internet these days in this situation ...ok i'll wait..",3,3
47069,28,"student: i don't know all the symbols but i recognise a lot of them every time i check a word in the dictionary (very often) i have a look at the phonemic script  teacher: ok i understand - well, can be useful i think - once you get used to it it's very quick - that's great you check in the dictionary",3,2
47070,28,"student: wait, do you check words in the dictionary?? or look up?  teacher: the more i teach the more i focus on pronunciation to b ehonest you can say check or look up - both fine (and common) i guess 'chec' could imply you kinda know a bit already and 'look up' can suggest you know nothing you see? check' i mean a new phrasal verb by the way used by young people (but not by me) = 'search up' as in: i'll search it up on my phone' - sounds horrible to me but lots of kids are saying that now!",4,3
47071,28,"student: i think it's very important (pronunciation). i always check it when i have doubts because it's been difficult for me to make people understand me sometimes when i lived in england... since i spend some time there the first time i went, i realised how important it is to know the correct pronunciation of words... i won't use search up then ;)  teacher: yes i think that's great you focused on that - i remember the small amount of time i heard you speaking you seemd to have very good pronunciation (especailly for a spanish speaker - sorry that sounds like a back-handed compliment)",4,4
47072,28,student: ohh thank you! i try hard :) what does back-handed compliment mean??  teacher: um...a compliment that could be understood as an insult,3,3
47073,28,student: hahah  teacher: as in your pronuncation is good but only compared with other spanish speakers who are generally terrible (and no i don't mean that entirely) ..but many spaniards do need to focus more on pronunciation of course!,3,1
47074,28,student: i understand what you mean now  teacher: it can be very frustrating if you don't do it fairly early on..,2,2
47075,28,"student: i think it's our teachers fault (teachers here). they don't care too much about it, here grammar seems to be veryyy important  teacher: yes i'm sure you're right - i guess it'll change with the exposure to authentic speech on the internet etc it's definitely changed already in my expereince the average pronunciation of my younger students is better than 10 years ago for example cos they watch netflix all the time... or youtube or whatever",4,3
47076,28,"student: yes, that's terrible. every time i try to record a whatsapp message in english my phone doens't get a word :(. when i do it in spanish it works perfectly...  teacher: oh really? its not because it's on the 'spanish' setting is it? i'm sure you 're good enough to get a device to understand you no?",3,2
47077,28,student: do you know what i am talking about? when you speak and your phone writes what you say...  teacher: yes yes i know,2,1
47078,28,"student: nooo, in english, i change the language when i want to do it in english  teacher: hey <student> did you notice my spanish intefernce just not - seriously, when i put 'no' at the end of my sentence - that's not normal - it something i retained from speaking spanish years ago... cos it's more efficient",3,3
47079,28,"student: haha no, i haven't realised until now that you said it. it's true that 'no' it's much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc  teacher: yes you know that in 50 years linguists predict that we will all say just 'innit?' in english (which currently is associated with lower class speakers) i say it for 'isn't it?' which is a little bit lower class (!) but some poeple say it for all question tags (which is definitely more frowned upon by snobs)",3,4
47080,28,student: i'd be very happy to take that lower class speakers habit!! ;)  teacher: yes you'll be fine in 50 years! ok <student> i guess that's an hour more or less right? i'm really sorry again about the delay today - i'll speak to you tomorrow at 13:15!,3,2
47081,28,"student: it feels very artificial for me to use the question tags, when i use them i feel very posh haha yes, thank you very much! see you tomorrow :)  teacher: reaelly? that's funny! well ,they do sound good fore most people so keep using them is my advice! ok bye",3,2
47083,9,"student: hi  teacher: hi <student>, how's it going - all ok?",3,2
47084,9,"student: i'm fine, thank you you??  teacher: ok great - listen, i heard about your ielts exam by the way...",4,3
47085,9,"student: oh, i've forgotten about telling you my score was 6.5  teacher: do you mean: 'i forgot to tell you'? yes tell me now - oh you just did ok 6.5 - that's great welldone! tell me more..",3,2
47086,9,"student: reading was 7, listening was 6.5, and the oters were 6.  teacher: ok cool - what were the writing questions about?",3,2
47087,9,"student: task 1 was about a bar chat, so it wasn't difficult, and task 2 was about relationships with neiborhood.  teacher: ok right...you mean 'with neighbours'?",2,3
47088,9,"student: both topics were usual ones, but i couldn't find enough synonyms. oh, yeah i do  teacher: ok - but it sounds like you must have done pretty well with your language anyway, does that mean i won't see you in an ielts class again?!",3,2
47089,9,"student: at least, i think i could achieve the tasks.  teacher: yes, you were always good at understanding the basic task, which is really important (and not as easy as it seems sometimes)..",3,1
47090,9,"student: i'm leaving here in two weeks, and i'm taking private lessons until then. however, i'm thinking about doing master degree in the uk.  teacher: oh of course right - so yeah definitely no more ielts! how are the classes at the moment? oh wow! a master's degree here - i thought you'd be going back - you seemed a bit homesick....!",3,3
47091,9,student: it's good. i can speak english more than when i was in group lesson class.  teacher: yes of course - i'm sure you're making faster progress - well if you stayed longer in england to do a masters's you'd definitely get more fluent right?! master's,4,2
47092,9,"student: i need to go back and starting going to university for 1 year.  teacher: oh ok - so you'd have time to think about returning to the uk...i don't know...once you start eating that real japanese food again...! ok <student>, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible)? my small example = my daughters always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor it drives me mad! (sorry im old!) hes always..ing. .it really drives me mad/crazy .it does my head in (informal). or..you could be one of your parents complaining about you in the past - you decide!",4,3
47093,9,"student: sorry, my network is not good today.  teacher: no problem",2,1
47094,9,"student: please send me again.  teacher: ok <student>, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible)? my small example = my daughters always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor it drives me mad! (sorry im old!) hes always..ing. .it really drives me mad/crazy .it does my head in (informal). ok?",3,3
47095,9,student: my sister's wearing my clothes without telling me!!  teacher: ah ok - is that true?! ok so: my sister's always wearing my clothes without telling me. (you need the 'always' in there too) - and...how does that make you feel?,3,4
47096,9,student: it's okay if she keeps it clean...  teacher: ok right - so you don't mind too much...as long as she keeps them clean! i get it! i forgot you had a sister - what's she doing again?,4,3
47097,9,student: she is starting going university. going to university  teacher: oh right - so she's starting in march/april - that's the start of the academic year in japan right? what's she going to study?,3,3
47098,9,"student: from april!! and she is studying nutrition.  teacher: ok right - that sounds like a degree with a job at the end of it! by the way, you'd say: 'she's starting university' (without 'go') hey <student>, going back to the masters idea do you have any idea where you might do it in the uk?",3,3
47099,9,"student: i'm thinking about edinborough and bristol  teacher: oh right, edinburgh and bristol - both quite cool cities i'd say - have you been to either of them before?",4,2
47100,9,"student: no, i've never been there.  teacher: well like i say both a bit cooler than cambridge! and bigger too - i guess that's partly why...<student> back to complaining - imagine your parents what do you think they would have said to complain about you in the past? (you have to imagine they spoke english for this obviously!). give me an example.the problem and how they felt if you can",3,3
47101,9,student: my parents would say i'm not good at cleaning my room.  teacher: ok right - a common parental complaint! can you try saying that and using the structures from earlier? begin with: he... he's always...,2,3
47102,9,student: he is always making his room messed up  teacher: ok great! yes that's good...so 'he's always leaving his room in a mess' is good and how did they feel about it...?,3,3
47103,9,student: they thought it was because i would have a mental disease.haha  teacher: oh god - i don't know if you're serious! 'they thought i might have a mental illness/be mentally ill' is good - no i think it means you were a perfectly normal teenager right?!,4,4
47104,9,"student: yes, at least i think so.haha  teacher: i think so! any more complaints from you? about..i don't know...classmates (you don't have to use names!) or people in your accommodation",3,3
47105,9,student: she is always trying to win against me. it was really annoying.  teacher: thanks - 'annoying' = good word here! do you mean like in a game?,4,3
47106,9,"student: no, i mean in ielts practices.  teacher: ok i see - you mean get a higher score!",2,2
47107,9,"student: yes, i do.  teacher: <student> just to practise this quickly can you think of a way (or more than one if possible) :liverpool 1 - barcelona 0 sorry - of describing that score i gave you in a sentence",3,3
47108,9,student: liverpool won against barcelona for 1-0.  teacher: can you delete one word to make it correct?,4,3
47109,9,student: against??  teacher: no try again!,2,1
47110,9,student: for?? for??  teacher: yes that's it!,1,2
47111,9,student: i didn't know that.  teacher: ok so your sentience is possible/good -can you try another sentence with the word 'beat' for the same score,2,3
47112,9,student: barcelona was beaten by liverpool 1-0.  teacher: ok great! or: liverpool beat barcelona 1-0 ('one nil' remember in speaking!) - also we normally say 'were' for a football team in speaking and 'they' you see,4,4
47113,9,"student: ah, because they are a team, right??  teacher: yes that's it - you can use the singular too though especailly more formally (or imagine like thinking about the club as a company or whatever - definitely in that situation) so <student> - because you're ielts example is not exactly like a knockout competiition you could say she's always trying to beat me (as in my score) but not really win against me - ok?!",3,3
47114,9,"student: yes, i mean so. even though ielts isn't a competiton...  teacher: ok - you mean you still want to say 'win' - ok you can, you can - it's possible! to really emphasis she though of it like a compettiion i guess! thought ok <student> - we'll have to stop there - thanks a lot- speak to you soon",3,2
47115,9,"student: yeah, i think so.  teacher: cheers!",1,1

47121,205,"student: than i have to finish watching a vebinar about some marketing staff  teacher: do you mean the people who work for the school or some work you need to do for the school? the school staff ah, now i see! it's stuff. some marketing stuff and staff = people who work in the company a staff meeting; staff room",3,3
47122,205,"student: because they have limited access till 22/02 and i'm not sure that i'll have enough time on the weekend ah! sure! so in both sentences i meant stuff  teacher: they are pronounced quite differently too, i would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff yes, i got you) sounds interesting, the webinar on marketing!",3,4
47123,205,student: i would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff - i'll do it! ok it's about lovemarks )  teacher: lovemarks??,2,2
47124,205,student: the brands which love their clients  teacher: interesting!,3,1
47125,205,"student: maybe do you know the girl who founded here in ukraine a big chain of places where you can rent the wardrobe  teacher: oh, where you can hire some clothes? i remember vaguely, something starting with o...",3,3

47128,205,student: actually i know her from our teenage ) but we have not communicated till that times )  teacher: you haven't communicated ___ those times,2,2
47129,205,"student: now she decided to do an online intensive course about lovemark and then she will do a big 2,5 month course about brand you haven't communicated from those times  teacher: since!)) or 'since that time'",2,3
47130,205,"student: oh! since! since that time! of course!  teacher: wow, she's really branched out i've looked it up, apparently, lovemarks are supposed to replace the idea of brands. i've never heard about this stuff!",3,4
47131,205,"student: branched out? ) it means that she has lots of branches of her business?  teacher: branch out = good business word; to start to do something different from what you usually do for example, if you now opened an alma bakery for students to go to after classes, that would be branching out yes, it comes from the idea of branches of a business",4,2
47132,205,"student: i see the webinar was about two weeks ago and i didn't watch the third part when i had access  teacher: oh, i see, you need to do it while <student's child>'s with her nanny, makes sense!",3,1
47133,205,student: and now they prolongated access so i have to watch it  teacher: nice!,2,1
47134,205,"student: how can i say ?  teacher: ok, have you had a chance to watch the video about a nursery?",2,2
47135,205,"student: exactly ?  teacher: oh sorry, hold on a second",1,1
47136,205,student: yes! i've watched it  teacher: i would say 'manage to watch' manage to do something (not necessarily the idea of time) or 'i need to watch it while i still have access',3,2
47137,205,"student: aha! thank you!  teacher: generally, uspet' is 'be on time', e.g. i was on time for a zoom call with my colleague but it's different here, isn't it?",3,1
47138,205,"student: yes! it's different!  teacher: ok, the nursery! could you tell me in a few words what happened there?",3,3
47139,205,"student: so it was a trial ) they changed toys in the nursery to some usual staff: magnets, metal objects etc. just usual things )  teacher: stuff! :)",3,2
47140,205,"student: stuff  teacher: :) yes, sure, go on!",3,1
47141,205,student: ok! so the trial showed that it's even better for imagination and children's dexterity to play with this stuff )  teacher: yes! did the children like it?,3,3
47142,205,"student: it's better than toys also because the stuff like than prevent children from gender  teacher: yes, from forming gender stereotypes, like female princesses vs. male superheroes, right?",3,4
47143,205,student: so in the group of 2 years old the children were completely happy to play with the new 'toys' without the?  teacher: the new toys? the new toys is absolutely fine because they are the toys we've been talking about,3,2
47144,205,"student: forming gender stereotypes, yes! can i use just gender?  teacher: hmm, no, it doesn't really work. let me see what the context was",2,3
47145,205,"student: ok! but three years old people ) at first were surprised why the adults decided to change their toys )  teacher: gender is something that can be reinforced through toys. as in, behaviour associated with men / women can be reinforced through toys but i don't think it can work with 'prevent from'",3,2
47146,205,"student: gender behaviour, characteristics and roles societies associate with men or women they have it after the video  teacher: yes, true",2,1
47147,205,"student: ah, i see  teacher: hmm, i'm having a think now. what do you think about toys and gender?",3,2
47148,205,student: i don't like the stuff like barbie for it  teacher: ok! why not?),3,2
47149,205,"student: lot's of princesses and other female characters are too 'female'  teacher: yes, the word here is 'feminine' fem..nn",2,2
47150,205,"student: this too big eyes, too big breast - i hate it  teacher: #error!",0,1
47151,205,"student: ah, ok!  teacher: yes, 'female' is about the sex, male vs. female feminine is about looks / behaviour feminine vs. masculine",3,3
47152,205,"student: but i'm not sure about the idea that we have to deprive our children all usual toys as dolls or figures and give them just kitchen stuff or something like that  teacher: i think today's cartoons are trying hard to change the stereotypes, but there is still a long way to go!",3,3
47153,205,"student: deprive of  teacher: yes, i'm with you here! good use of the verb 'deprive', it goes with 'of' yes, good correction :))",3,1
47154,205,"student: )) i love toys actually! )  teacher: me too! and i noticed, when <teacher's child> plays with his lego figurines, for example, he will give them so many roles, it almost doesn't matter what they look like",4,3
47155,205,"student: but dolls and figures are not my favorites, i like lego and puzzles and books with stickers and activities )  teacher: yes, there's more to do with them!",3,2
47156,205,student: do you have problems with their hairs?  teacher: the lego people's?,2,3
47157,205,"student: our elsa looses her hairs everytime )))))  teacher: oh no, poor elsa! we swap their hair and hats all the time, it's so funny!",3,4
47158,205,"student: yes! yesterday our anna and elsa have changed their hair )  teacher: i actually think, in terms of gender stereotypes, it would do more for children if they saw grown-ups in different 'non-traditional' roles. for example, if they had a male teacher at the nursery (but i bet they don't)",3,1
47159,205,"student: i even 'didn't recognize' them )\ yes! i bet you know the theory that they learn not from our words but from our behavior  teacher: haha, yes, that's our favourite game. quick grammar quiz! anna's hair ___ red and elsa's hair ___ blond yes! i'm sure toys have less effect than actual grown-up role models",3,2
47160,205,"student: so it would work better if the daddy washes , for example and the mommy hang the picture  teacher: yes, if daddy does the dishes! exactly))",3,3
47161,205,student: do the dishes - so?  teacher: that's right! or 'wash up',2,2
47162,205,"student: the daddy and the mommy is right? )  teacher: for example, he always washes up after dinner yes, correct! that's why the machine is called a dishwasher",3,3
47163,205,student: ah! i see  teacher: a dishwasher (dishes) and a washing machine (clothes),2,2
47164,205,"student: ok! thank you!  teacher: look, the grammar quiz is following you. anna's hair ___ red and elsa's hair ___ blond",3,2
47165,205,"student: ok ) anna's hair are red and elsa's hair are blond i'm not sure  teacher: yes, that's a very typical russian thing. hair is singular in english! like in ukrainian",3,2
47166,205,student: hair is un uncountable noun  teacher: anna's hair is red etc.,2,1
47167,205,student: ok! so anna's hair is red and elsa's hair is blond  teacher: i've just washed my hair. --- i've just washed it,1,2
47168,205,"student: actually professional staff usually use in russian it's singular too but it is more like professional slang  teacher: yes, like that! am i right that it's singular in ukrainian?",3,3
47169,205,"student: you are completely right! -   teacher: yay, i remembered! so it's like in ukrainian oh, did i tell you that schools will probably re-open on the 8th of march?",3,2
47170,205,"student: it's a good example! ) i'm so happy for you!  teacher: boris is going to talk to the people on monday haha, thank you! but! hairdressers will only re-open later. so children will go to school with diy haircuts))) including <teacher's child>",3,3
47171,205,"student: )))  teacher: i would say 'mummy haircuts' but that's gender stereotyping :))) i've now got professional scissors and i was quite pleased with how i did his hair last time, but now it's growing out and i can see all the mistakes",1,2
47172,205,student: i know than in austria hairdressers were closed so my friend <student's friend> become a 'hairdresser'or her husband for several months )  teacher: i haven't had a trim since october! it's getting way too long,2,2
47173,205,"student: ok one more thing about gender stereotipes but i'm happy that i don't have to do it for <student's child> )  teacher: yes, i bet!",2,1
47174,205,"student: but you know, i have <student's sister-in-law> )  teacher: ok, lovely. i'll let you go, great work today! hope you'll have a productive",3,0

47182,143,teacher: cool! i've got to organize ours too  student: jab it's like privivka?,2,3
47183,143,"teacher: yes, that's right!  student: oh! super. did you do it before?",3,2
47184,143,teacher: the official word is 'vaccination' (as the process) or a vaccine  student: because for us it's the fist time first,3,1
47185,143,"teacher: have you had a dose of your flu vaccine? have you been vaccinated against flu this year? but people just say, have you had a flu jab?  student: wow? something new for me in all senses ))",3,3
47186,143,"teacher: is it the first time you've had a flu jab? that's good :)  student: ok, and why i need present perfect here? )",3,3
47187,143,"teacher: well, <teacher's child> gets his at school, and <teacher's husband>'s company gave him a voucher to pay for a flu jab it's the first time + present perfect  student: ah, super!",2,2
47188,143,"teacher: it's a bit unusual that it's present perfect but it makes sense because it's in the present, something you've just done  student: it's the first time + present perfect. ok, so no past? and when i use the expression it's the first time i have to use just present perfect?",3,4
47189,143,"teacher: no! unless you're talking about the past. it was the first time + past simple / past perfect yes, that's right e.g. my parents took me to a restaurant when i was 16. it was the first time i had tried wine in the past  student: ah, ok! thank you",3,2
47190,143,teacher: i can't think of anything that i've done for the first time recently :)))  student: haha,2,1
47191,143,teacher: it's been the first year that i've worked at home so much  student: some new food?,2,2
47192,143,"teacher: or something like that! it's the first time i've tried tacos  student: ) ok, it's clear. thank you!",2,1
47193,143,"teacher: i should ask, maybe i'm also eligible for a flu jab voucher like <teacher's husband>... i want one now! but children, the elderly and pregnant women get a flu jab for free in the uk because they are more v--------- to flu  student: vulnerable )",3,3
47194,143,teacher: remember the word? meaning that flu can be more serious for them yes! well done :)  student: unfortunately we don't have the same system here in ukraine even more,3,2
47195,143,"teacher: no, it's a shame! it's a good system  student: you know that <student's husband>'s mum works as a pediatric (?)",3,3
47196,143,"teacher: a pediatrician yes, i remember!  student: sure! thank you ) ok, so she needs a flu jab",3,2
47197,143,"teacher: pi.di.tr.n ah, that makes sense! can she get a free one?  student: and the clinic where she is working has to do it for her for free but they don't have the vaccine",3,3
47198,143,"teacher: oh no, this is awful!!  student: and they've given 500 hrs to each doctor to do it",3,2
47199,143,"teacher: well, that's something i suppose  student: but today we've spend 1100 for each person",2,2
47200,143,"teacher: oh my goodness, that's so dear! it's only about 10-12 pounds here i think  student: it's a shame/ they've given just half oh! it's interesting",3,3
47201,143,"teacher: yes, awful! does she work at a state hospital or a private place?  student: it's a french vaccine as i know at a state (",3,2
47202,143,"teacher: ha, i bet it'll be more expensive after brexit here too  student: maybe you are right!",3,2
47203,143,teacher: unfortunately  student: and we haven't done the flu jab for <student's child>,2,3
47204,143,"teacher: there is a very strong anti-vaccination movement in the uk (and all over the world it seems!). it's not as strong as in ukraine, but still bad! and now the government is worried that people won't get vaccinated against covid when there is finally a vaccine  student: we've talked about with <student's husband>'s mum",3,2
47205,143,"teacher: oh, it's a nose spray for children here, not a jab, thankfully  student: she said that if <student's child> contacts just with us and nanny now she maybe doesn't need if if all people around would get the flu jab",3,3
47206,143,"teacher: exactly, she is pretty protected  student: so i'm thinking about.",3,2
47207,143,teacher: if all people around ____ the flu jab  student: i mean <student's child>s flu jab has gone? oh have gone,2,1
47208,143,"teacher: just 'get', not 'would get'. you need a present simple if everyone gets a flu jab, <student's child> won't have to if present simple, will  student: <teacher> : oh, it's a nose spray for children here, not a jab, thankfully",3,3
47209,143,"teacher: first conditional :)  student: what do you mean? i've missed a context, sorry",2,2
47210,143,"teacher: oh sorry! i mean the flu vaccine for children is in the form of a nose spray, not an injection  student: if present simple, will - sure. i've been thinking it's not real )",3,3
47211,143,teacher: but other vaccines are injections (jabs)  student: really? it's a spray?,2,2
47212,143,"teacher: ah, if it's not real, that's second conditional. if past simple, would if everyone got vaccinated, the world would be a safer place  student: i think here we have just injections",3,3
47213,143,"teacher: yes! so good! because jabs are distressing to children, of course  student: ah, ok. sorry, the conditional aren't my 'silnaya stoorona' )",3,2

47248,143,"teacher: yes, because it doesn't say 'one more'  student: last one and they didnt scrimp on dessert the christmas pudding would be decorated in holly, doused in brandy, and the palace steward would carry it, flaming, into the royal dining room. scrimp in holly, doused in brandy",3,3
47249,143,"teacher: oh, the christmas pudding thing? because there's so much brandy in it, they light it and it's on fire basically when they serve it if you scrimp, you save money (or some resource) i'm scrimping because i want to save for new shoes or something like that  student: ah! thank you!",3,2
47250,143,"teacher: but the royals don't scrimp on dessert, which means that they eat a lot of it, no saving a holly tree is a spiky tree with pretty leaves and red berries it's used as christmas decoration  student: ah! sure! i know it! ) thank you!!!",4,2

47258,143,"teacher: i know, so boring! but maybe she's like obama who had 7 identical suits when he was a president and wore one every day  student: but in general i think she eats the food she must eats )",3,1
47259,143,"teacher: just not to have to think about what to wear oh, because she is the symbol of the uk?  student: maybe and you know she looks like a very conservative persone",3,2
47260,143,"teacher: definitely! she basically always wears the same dress, but in different colours, doesn't she?  student: sure! but she is nice )",3,2
47261,143,"teacher: when i was reading it, i thought it had to be so frustrating for an excellent chef to be chopping meat for her dogs or peeling carrots for the horses :)  student: boring, but nice )",3,1
47262,143,teacher: that don't even need their carrots to be peeled)))  student: hahaha,3,2

53179,84,"teacher: have you got it?  student: yes    student: indeed, i did.",1,1
53180,84,"teacher: can you see the first picture? what do you think it could be?  student: hmm it looks like some food i think    student: well, from my perspective, it appears to resemble some sort of food.",3,2
53181,84,"teacher: it does, doesn't it? it's magnified of course  student: magnified?    student: amplified?",3,1
53182,84,"teacher: magnify = make an image bigger a magnifying glass is what we use to have a good look at really small objects  student: oh okay    student: ah, i see. understood.",3,1
53183,84,"teacher: what food do you think it might be?  student: the thing in the middle looks like a piece of apple but i don't think it is    student: it seems like there's a slice of apple in the center, but i'm not convinced it actually is.",3,3
53184,84,"teacher: aha, so it could be... could you make a sentence with one of the modals we talked about last time?  student: the thing in the middle could be a piece of apple    student: perhaps the object in question could potentially be a fragment of an apple.",3,2
53185,84,"teacher: good one! click on the answer underneath the picture, please :)  student: sushi!    student: sushi!",3,1
53186,84,teacher: yes!  student: i love sushi    student: sushi is my absolute favorite!,1,3
53187,84,teacher: me too! it's much more popular in ukraine than in the uk  student: really?why?    student: no way! what's the reason behind that?,3,4
53188,84,"teacher: i'm not sure! but there are so many sushi restaurants in kyiv and only a few in cambridge, for example  student: can i ask you a question?    student: may i inquire about something?",3,2
53189,84,"teacher: it's becoming more popular now, though yes sure!  student: what fast food restaurants are popular in uk?    student: could you please enlighten me on the popular fast food restaurants in the uk?",3,3
53190,84,"teacher: good question! mcdonalds and kfc are here of course but traditional english 'fast food' or takeaway food is fish and chips there are lots of fish-and-chips shops in every town, or 'chippies'  student: i heard something about fish and chips    teacher: that's an excellent question! well, when it comes to fast food options, we have mcdonalds and kfc readily available. however, if you're looking for a taste of traditional english takeaway food, you can't go wrong with fish and chips. you'll find an abundance of fish-and-chips shops, affectionately known as 'chippies', in every town.",4,2
53191,84,"teacher: yes, it sorry it's white fish deep fried in some batter and chunky chips. quite nice but not everyday food for me!  student: why batter, but not butter?    student: i'm curious, why do they use batter instead of butter?",3,3
53192,84,"teacher: then there are lots of places where you can get a coffee and a nice sandwich, such as costa, starbucks, pret-a-manger  student: i know starbucks! i want to drink some coffee there one day    student: oh, i'm familiar with starbucks! it would be great to have a cup of coffee there sometime.",3,2
53193,84,"teacher: oh, batter is what you make out of flour, egg, maybe a bit of milk or water, or even beer. then you put the fish in the batter and fry it you also make some batter to make pancakes!  student: oohh    student: how fascinating!",4,1
53194,84,"teacher: is there starbucks in kyiv?  student: no    student: unfortunately, no.",2,2
53195,84,"teacher: but i bet you've seen it in israel?  student: no, there is not starbucks in israel and ukraine:(    student: unfortunately, starbucks is not available in israel and ukraine:(",2,3
53196,84,"teacher: ah well, i'm sure you will one day! what is fast food like in israel? i know about kyiv! mcdonalds and domashnya kukhnya!  student: mcdonalds is the good one but for example their burger is like our double burger!    student: mcdonalds is actually quite enjoyable however, it's worth mentioning that their burger portions are comparable to our double burgers!",3,2
53197,84,"teacher: do you mean burgers in israeli mcdonalds are bigger than in ukrainian ones?  student: and they don't eat cheese with meat, so when i made a burger for myself with meat and cheese, they gave me it without any cheese! yes, it is    student: it's interesting, in israel they don't have the tradition of eating cheese with meat. so, when i asked for a burger with both meat and cheese, they served it to me without any cheese! it was quite surprising, to be honest.",3,3
53198,84,"teacher: sure, it's not kosher, right?  student: yes    student: indeed.",2,1
53199,84,"teacher: interesting! oh, something interesting i found the other day there is a chef from ukraine, and she is taking instagram by storm in this country!  student: it is raining now    student: the weather has taken a turn for the worse. it's raining outside.",4,0
53200,84,teacher: she has written three (i think) amazing cookbooks about ukrainian cooking in english  student: wow    student: that's absolutely impressive!,3,2
53201,84,"teacher: i really recommend her instagram account, @oliahercules  student: okay, wait a minute and i will find her    student: sure, just give me a moment and i'll find her.",3,2
53202,84,teacher: it's beautiful (and yummy!) and will be great for your english because it's all your familiar foods but in english  student: i am her subscriber now    student: i have become a subscriber of hers now.,2,3
53203,84,teacher: me too! hope you'll enjoy it :) is it raining in kyiv then?  student: i am not in kyiv now    student: i'm actually not in kyiv at the moment.,3,3

53205,84,"teacher: ah, i heard it's really nice, but i've never been  student: my cousins, grandma, aunt and aunt's husband live here    student: it's actually quite lovely here. my cousins, grandma, aunt, and aunt's husband all call this place home.",2,4
53206,84,"teacher: i see! are you in the city or the country?  student: what do you mean?    student: i'm sorry, i don't quite grasp your question.",2,2
53207,84,teacher: are you in vinnytsa the city or in a village near it?  student: city    student: i'm in the city.,3,1
53208,84,teacher: country = countryside (in this case)  student: okay then    student: understood.,2,1
53209,84,"teacher: i see! is it very different from kyiv?  student: i think yes    student: well, i believe there are some noticeable differences.",3,3
53210,84,teacher: in what way?  student: kyiv is bigger    student: kyiv is significantly larger.,2,2
53211,84,"teacher: sure)  student: and in vinnytsa there are more old people (like my grandma)    student: additionally, vinnytsa has a higher population of elderly individuals, such as my dear grandmother.",2,3
53212,84,"teacher: oh interesting! young people probably move to kyiv and then retire somewhere quieter, right?  student: and think there are more transport in vinnytsa yes, maybe    student: it's true, vinnytsa does offer a wider range of transportation options. indeed, that could be a possibility.",3,2
53213,84,"teacher: you mean there is more public transport?  student: yes in vinnytsa the most part of people don't have their own car    student: that's correct. in vinnytsa, the majority of people don't own a car.",3,2
53214,84,"teacher: and vinnytsa's got the famous fountains  student: yes    student: oh, really? that's interesting!",3,3
53215,84,"teacher: i see! it's probably better for the environment, to use public transport  student: i saw one of th why?    student: i happened to come across one recently, but i'm curious as to why it's considered better for the environment.",3,2
53216,84,"teacher: well, if everyone owns a car and drives around, there are more emissions per person than if everyone shares a bus or trolleybus! trolleybuses are very green  student: oh, i see    student: ah, i understand now.",3,1
53217,84,teacher: are there any trolleybuses?  student: of couse course *    student: absolutely! we definitely have trolleybuses.,2,2
53218,84,teacher: cool!  student: there are a lot of them we also use them    student: it's amazing how many there are. they're also really useful.,3,3
53219,84,"teacher: yes, they are supposed to be more green because they use electricity, not petrol  student: i like that idea    student: i find that concept quite appealing.",3,2
53220,84,"teacher: me too! i know you probably didn't have a chance to revise the new words from the last time, but i did prepare a little something to practise them for you!  student: that's okay    student: no worries.",3,1
53221,84,"teacher: the words are debunk, deduce - deduction, exploration, abandon and evidence could you fill in the gaps, please?  student: okay    student: sure, i can do that.",2,2
53222,84,"teacher: to ____ what happened that night, the police have to look at the ____: a fresh scratch on the car, a broken lock, some footprints on the carpet.  student: abandon and deduction ?    student: so, it's all about abandonment and deduction, right?",2,3
53223,84,"teacher: mmm, not quite  student: both are not okay, or the one?    student: so, neither of them is acceptable? or just one of them?",2,2
53224,84,teacher: first gap: understand something from looking at the facts none  student: debunk?    student: disprove?,3,3
53225,84,teacher: nope!  student: deduce    student: infer,1,2
53226,84,teacher: yes! and second gap?  student: evidence?    student: any evidence to support that?,3,3
53227,84,"teacher: yes! another one people used to believe the earth was flat, but that theory has been _____  student: debunked    student: disproved",4,4
53228,84,"teacher: yes, correct! as a baby he was ____ by his mother and left at the fire station  student: abandoned    teacher: absolutely right! when he was just a baby, his mother abandoned him and left him at the fire station.",3,3

53231,84,"teacher: yes, correct! abandon ship' is also an idiom, it means to leave a failing project / bad situation before it gets worse ok, another one wildfires and storms could be ____ of climate change.  student: evidence    teacher: absolutely right! 'abandon ship' is actually an idiom that suggests the wise decision to exit a failing project or a troublesome situation before it worsens. alright, let's move on to the next question. climate change could potentially be indicated by the occurrence of wildfires and storms.",3,3
53232,84,"teacher: yes, well done! and the one from today the print in the old book was so small, she couldn't read without a ____ ____.  student: magnifing a picture?    student: enlarging an image?",3,2

53234,84,"teacher: glass!  student: oh    student: oops, sorry!",1,1
53235,84,teacher: magnifying glass  student: okay    student: understood.,1,1
53236,84,"teacher: a dictionary definition: a piece of curved glass that makes objects look bigger than they are ok, <student>, a little bit of homework for you. if you have a scroll through olia hercules' instagram account and find a recipe you particularly like, could you tell me about it next time? what ingredients are used and how it's made?  student: okay    student: understood.",3,2
53237,84,teacher: lovely! thursday 10 am?  student: yes goodbye!    student: absolutely! farewell!,1,1
53238,84,"teacher: lovely, have a good day!  student: have a nice day too!    student: you too, have a great day!",3,1

53241,221,teacher: hi <student>!  student: how are you?    student: i hope you're doing well.,3,1
53242,221,"teacher: how are you? all good, thank you!  student: i am good thank you :. finally i can go back to the office from time to time! i guess 'i can finally go back...' would have been a better word-ordering...anyway everything is good    student: i'm doing well, thank you. it's such a relief to be able to go back to the office occasionally! i suppose 'i can finally go back...' would have been a more fitting phrase...but regardless, everything is going smoothly.",2,3
53243,221,"teacher: oh really? oh yes, i remember, you mentioned it last time! have you been yet? do you have to wear a mask and take precautions?  student: except for the pandemic...    student: well, apart from the pandemic...",3,2
53244,221,"teacher: yes, i can finally go back does sound better!  student: i am there currently...i have to be tested every second day, wear an ffp2 mask in the common areas... but it is a nice change, from time to time    student: well, i'm actually already there... i have to undergo testing every other day and wear an ffp2 mask in the common areas... but you know what? it's actually quite refreshing to experience a change every now and then.",3,4
53245,221,"teacher: right, i see! i can imagine. does it mean things are looking up in austria in terms of corona?  student: hmm, i am not sure about the meaning of the expression 'things are looking up'...if it means that cases are increasing...you are right. germany has already started a strong lockdown, i believe austria will follow suit if things go on like this...    student: well, germany has already implemented a strict lockdown. i think austria might do the same if the situation continues like this.",3,3
53246,221,"teacher: oh no, the opposite. if things are looking up, the situation is improving. i'm sorry to hear this is not the case! oh no, that's bad news! very sorry to hear that! today's the anniversary of the first lockdown in the uk  student: i see...austria and italy both went in lockdown earlier about a week ago...    student: i understand...austria and italy both implemented lockdown measures earlier, approximately a week ago...",3,2
53247,221,"teacher: yes, i've read about the third wave in italy... awful!  student: hmm, no, i guess more than a week ago, but i can't remember exactly when...unfortunately vaccinations are not going as initially planned there are few doses and politicians mishandled the vaccine situation when blocking astrazeneca .if you ask me.... now a lot of people do not trust it anymore...the press has its share of fault too, unfortunately...    student: well, it's been over a week since i last checked, but i can't recall the exact date. it's quite unfortunate that the vaccination process hasn't gone according to plan. there seems to be a shortage of doses, and the politicians made a mess of things by blocking astrazeneca. personally, i think that has led to a loss of trust in the vaccine among many people. and, unfortunately, the press also shares some responsibility for the situation.",3,3
53248,221,"teacher: yes, that was my impression too. it all got really political .probably reflecting a worsened relationship with the uk.. but astrazeneca is a tried and tested vaccine, and people suffer as a result of this row oh, i see! yes, this is really bad! trust is everything  student: last week our childminder was supposed to get jabbed, but had a last minute panic attack and decided to renounce taking it...    student: our childminder was scheduled to receive the vaccine last week, but she had a sudden panic attack and chose not to go through with it... this is really unfortunate.",3,2
53249,221,"teacher: right, i see. it's the worst!  student: she has a difficult situation in her family, so we were sort of expecting this, but still it tells about the responsability of the press and politics...    student: unfortunately, her family is going through a challenging time, so we somewhat anticipated this. however, it truly highlights the accountability of the media and politicians...",3,3
53250,221,"teacher: yes, definitely! such a shame though. they'll have to work hard to get back on track!  student: yes, but it will take years for the public to rebuild the trust towards vaccines... indeed...anyhow, i see you sent me a pdf...before the lesson i have also done the last exercise of the paper    student: yes, it's going to be a long road to restore public confidence in vaccines... indeed... by the way, i noticed you sent me a pdf... i also completed the final exercise in the textbook before class.",3,2
53251,221,"teacher: you know what, 'to get jabbed' sounds like she was about to be punched. 'to get the jab' would be better here  student: oh, i see..that is quite a difference indeed... she was going to get the jab...    student: ah, i understand now. that does make quite a difference. so she was going to get the jab...",3,3
53252,221,"teacher: oh lovely, let me get my answer key for the reading, feel free to type your answers here yes, a subtle difference! ready when you are!  student: i am not too sure about all of them... 44 d,b 45 e, 46 c, 47 b, 48 a, 49 e, 50 b, 51 d, 52 a, 53 a,c but i tried to look for 'sentences which directly connect to the paragraph'...unfortunately i didn't print the paper so i couldn't underline them    student: i'm not entirely confident about all of them... 44 d,b 45 e, 46 c, 47 b, 48 a, 49 e, 50 b, 51 d, 52 a, 53 a,c i attempted to locate 'sentences that directly correlate with the paragraph'... unfortunately, i didn't have the paper printed, so i couldn't underline them.",3,2
53253,221,"teacher: yes, this is the right approach! what about 44 and 53? are you not sure which one fits better?  student: oh, i misread the assignment: i believed a line could be assigned to multiple paragraphs too which greatly increased my uncertainty about the overall result i woudl go with 44 b    student: oops, i made a mistake in understanding the assignment. i mistakenly thought that a line could be assigned to multiple paragraphs, which made me even more uncertain about the final outcome. in my opinion, 44 b would be the better choice.",3,3
53254,221,"teacher: ah, this is sometimes the case .two answers to one question., but then there would have been two numbers for example, in which paragraph does the author express his disappointment in his friend 55. 56.  student: i see...actually for the 53 i am unsure, a    student: i understand now. i'm actually not quite sure about number 53.",3,2
53255,221,"teacher: and you could answer in either order, not necessarily alphabetically ok, why is 44 b then?  student: when the technology was invented, in the form of photography, the social and cultural impact was immense.    student: the introduction of photography as a technological advancement had a profound influence on society and culture.",2,3
53256,221,"teacher: aha, i see. this is in the past though, and the question is about the possibility that photography can influence events in the world .at present.  student: i see, while the first sentence of d is indeed describing the possibility of change in the current time whether photography possesses the voice and power to instigate social change.    student: i see, the first sentence of option d is discussing the potential for change in the present time, specifically focusing on whether photography has the capacity to initiate social change.",3,3
53257,221,"teacher: exactly! 44. d then :. what about 53? why did you choose a?  student: i was going to answer with the sentence: ' the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of capturing the essence of our being alive.' but this justifies 52 a... so i believe i chose the wrong paragraph    student: initially, i had planned to respond with the statement: 'the photographic medium has played a significant role in capturing the essence of our existence.' however, this aligns more with option a for question 52... therefore, i realize i made an incorrect choice.",3,2
53258,221,"teacher: yes, this is exactly right :. your other idea was c, do you think that one holds water?  student: yes, its second sentence is quite explicit about this: 'it was seen not only as the culmination of visual representation...'    student: indeed, the second sentence leaves no room for doubt: 'it clearly signifies the pinnacle of visual representation...'",3,3
53259,221,teacher: absolutely!  student: i guess it really is easier to do these exercises with pen and paper...    student: i suppose using pen and paper does make these exercises more manageable...,3,1
53260,221,"teacher: everything else is correct, just those two that you were unsure about  student: great!    student: that's fantastic!",3,2
53261,221,"teacher: yes, i believe so! if you do take the exam one day, you might have a choice of paper-based or computer-based format, depending on the exam centre  student: i will make sure to ask beforehand about this possibility    student: i'll definitely inquire about this beforehand to be well-prepared.",3,3
53262,221,"teacher: and it's a bit awkward to be switching between windows here all the time, but i really wanted to give you a taste of what the exam is like mind you, the computer-based format should be equally convenient. for once, you won't have a pdf, it will all be in one program  student: i see :. well, i will think about it...for now i would say that i need to study a bit, but i could definitely do the exam :.    student: i understand your point. i will take some time to consider it. currently, i feel the need to study a bit more, but i am confident that i can successfully complete the exam.",3,2
53263,221,"teacher: well, there's probably no urgency for you, is there? but it's a nice way to motivate oneself if necessary ok, before we move on i'll just say that i'll take two weeks off teaching because my son will be home for easter holidays. i can offer you the next class on tuesday april 13 if the time is still good for you  student: no, indeed, but it is nice to see that it is something i could definitely do well, after some studying and with some tips on how to do the different exercises yes, that is okay with me :.    student: absolutely, it's reassuring to know that with some studying and guidance on the exercises, i can definitely excel in this. that works perfectly fine with me.",3,1
53264,221,"teacher: yes, exactly! lovely! have you got any nice plans for the less-than-ideal easter? are you going to make something nice?  student: if the weather is good i will hire an easter bunny... meaning i will hide some chocolates in the garden, the kids love it :.    student: if the weather permits, i am considering hiring an easter bunny... i plan to hide some chocolates in the garden, which the kids always adore.",4,3
53265,221,"teacher: ooh, yes, the egg hunt! it's a must here :.  student: but i don't think we will do much more...we might go to vienna this weekend for the palm's sunday, but i don't know...the covid situation is really precarious what about you? will you do some travelling for easter?    student: however, i doubt we'll be able to do much else. there's a possibility of going to vienna this weekend for palm sunday, but honestly, i'm not sure. the current covid situation is quite concerning. how about you? any plans for easter travels?",3,2
53266,221,"teacher: it sounds like you are where we were in january :. we're so used to being locked down now, no one's enterntaining any thoughts of going anywhere...  student: .maybe the correct way to write it 'we will go to vienna for palm sunday? i am really unsure here.    student: i'm not entirely sure, but could it be possible for us to consider going to vienna for palm sunday? i'm feeling a bit uncertain about it.",3,1
53267,221,"teacher: well, the only thing we'll be able to do is go for a drive, to the seaside or the forest or one of the beautiful gardens yes, i think it's palm sunday, no article!  student: that's already a nice idea :. hopefully we will do that too during easter...but i am deliberately keeping my vacation for later on, in the hope of going to italy :.    student: that sounds like a wonderful plan! i'm actually saving my vacation for later, with the hope of visiting italy.",3,2
53268,221,"teacher: wait, what did you mean? the verb? will / might? yes, i can imagine, save your holidays! or vacations, in american english  student: .no it was about the article...i changed the verb because it was easier to type.... you are right, my holidays...    student: actually, i was talking about the article... i altered the verb for convenience while typing... you're correct, i should have said my vacations...",3,1
53269,221,"teacher: sure. might is a very good verb there :. no, it's good either way! nothing wrong with american words :.  student: unfortunately the italian word for holidays is 'vacation', so this is a typical mistake that english teachers in italy will correct...    student: sadly, in italy, english teachers will often correct this mistake because the italian word for holidays is 'vacation'.",2,2
53270,221,"teacher: ah yes, of course it is!  student: sorry, the italian word is 'vacanza', not vacation ;.    student: apologies, i made a mistake. the correct word in italian is 'vacanza', not vacation.",3,1
53271,221,"teacher: sure ok, let's have a quick look at the writing paper i sent you, ok? let's focus on part 2 at the moment. .it's got 2 parts, 90 minutes to write both tasks. it's page 4 in the pdf  student: okay, i am there :. i have a question: in order to write number 5 i need to have read the book, is that correct?    student: understood, i have reached that page. i have a query: is it necessary to have read the book in order to write number 5?",4,2
53272,221,"teacher: great! the task is set for you in part 1, but you have a choice out of a few options in part 2. could you have a quick look and tell me which one looks most appealing to you? and which one would be best to write about .in terms of showing off good language. yes, that's right! in fact, not only do you need to have read the book, but you also need to have a relatively fresh memory of it, to know how to spell names of characters etc. which is why the book review task is a very rare choice among candidates and exam teachers :.  student: therefore number 5 is out of question in this case .i actually have the book 'girl with a pearl earring', but in the last years i am piling up some books because i have less time to read....    student: so, number 5 is definitely not an option here. i happen to have the book 'girl with a pearl earring', but lately, i've been accumulating a stack of unread books due to lack of time...",3,2
53273,221,"teacher: yes, i can relate to that!  student: i believe the easiest would be number 4...    student: in my opinion, the most straightforward option would be number 4...",2,1
53274,221,"teacher: i haven't read either of them, unfortunately yes, number 4 is a good choice!  student: to do well on the other examples i woudl need some language knowledge of specific fields, e.g. architecture, which i don't really have    student: in order to excel in the remaining examples, i would require some expertise in specialized areas like architecture, which i lack.",3,2
53275,221,"teacher: i'll just say here that you can pick an imaginary as well as a real situation in your life. some people find it easier to write about imaginary situations, and vice versa  student: i think i have the best real-life example ;. should i write the letter here?    student: i believe i have a fantastic real-life example in mind. would it be appropriate for me to share the letter here?",3,1
53276,221,"teacher: well, if you are describing a building, again, no one is looking for historical accuracy or the correct identification of an architectural style  student: sentence by sentence, and you'll comment along the way?    student: so, will you be providing feedback as i go through each sentence?",3,1
53277,221,"teacher: hold on, one second!  student: okay! i have also noticed it is already 13:52    student: sure! by the way, it's already 13:52.",3,1
53278,221,"teacher: for example, i was doing the 'desribing the building' task with my other c2 student, and she was describing a famous museum. she went, 'it was built in 1898'. true historically, but pretty much worthless in terms of earning language proficiency points!  student: i see... i need to use complex words, and show my proficiency... but it is difficult to do that while stating the date of something being built...    student: i understand now... it's challenging to demonstrate my proficiency while mentioning the construction date of something... i need to incorporate more sophisticated vocabulary and showcase my skills in a different way.",3,3

53280,221,"teacher: sorry about a rushed introduction. would you like to write it as homework over the break? if not, we can always do it sentence by sentence next time oh yes, sorry, i've just seen your reply. great!  student: i think it is better if i try to do it alone, thinking a bit about what i am writing.    teacher: apologies for the hasty introduction. would you prefer to complete it as homework during the break? alternatively, we can go through it sentence by sentence in our next session. oh, my apologies for not noticing your response earlier. excellent!",3,3
53281,221,"teacher: and the word count is important, too!  student: no problem :. then enjoy your holidays! .okay, i'll keep track of that.    student: sure thing! have a great break! i'll make sure to keep that in mind.",3,2

53286,7,"student: that's a great way to start the day. i also did some exercise this morning i have done, i guess  teacher: yeah? what did you do? i'll come back on the have done or did in a bit it is more common overall to use the present perfect for e.g. this morning if it hasnt finished yet butits by no means a rule and e.g. did is perfectly fine especially if youre focusing on the action itself tell me about your exercise if you like!    teacher: oh, really? what kind of exercise did you do? let's talk about the use of ""have done"" or ""did"" later. generally, it's more common to use the present perfect tense when referring to something that happened this morning and is still ongoing. however, it's not a strict rule. using ""did"" is perfectly acceptable, especially if you want to emphasize the action itself. if you want, feel free to share your exercise routine with me!",3,3
53287,7,"student: every morning i try to do something. this morning i went for a walk and afterwards i did some yoga at home. i'd love to run but i can't. i have something like arthrosis so if i force myself too much i get pain everywhere...  teacher: ok i see ...too bad about the running...but yoga is good i guess...do you find it's good mentally too? i've never really done it to be honest ...i'm too impatient i think!    teacher: ah, i understand now... it's a shame about the running, but at least you have yoga as a great alternative. does it also provide mental benefits? honestly, i've never given it a try myself... i suppose i'm just too restless to fully embrace it!",4,4
53288,7,"student: i understand. i thought the same before i did it the first time. it is actually very hard, people tent to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing but i think it is very good for your body. it is difficult to explain but the first time i went to a class i realised that if i don't do this kind of exercises (streching exercises mainly) i won't be able to do my shoes in 10 years haha stretching  teacher: yes i realise it's not easy really! i can see it's really good for you particularly for as you get older(!) - actually i do lots of runnign so i do have to do a lot of e.g. core exercises and stuff some of which aren't dissimilar to yoga...    teacher: oh, i understand now. it's definitely not a walk in the park! i can see how it becomes even more important as we age. personally, i'm into running, so i have to incorporate various core exercises that are quite similar to yoga.",4,3
53289,7,"student: what does 'dissimilar' mean??  teacher: not similar to ...so not dissimilar means...similar!    teacher: certainly! 'dissimilar' refers to something that is not similar. therefore, if something is not dissimilar, it means it is similar.",3,2
53290,7,"student: ok, thanks  teacher: it's bit of a complicated way of putting it i guess but common for educated speakers like me...(!)    teacher: it may sound a bit complex, but it's a common way of expressing it among educated individuals like myself.",3,1
53291,7,"student: i think running and yoga is a very good combination. an d when i say yoga i mean exercises that help you to stretch all your muscles  teacher: yes i'm sure you're right...i have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? but i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after christmas! by the way <student> i noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??! do you know what i mean by'typo' (=a typing error)    teacher: absolutely, your point is well taken. i've actually contemplated trying yoga in the past, so who knows? however, i have plans to practice kung fu with my daughter after christmas! on another note, <student>, i noticed you've written 'tent' instead of 'tend' a couple of times - was that simply a typo? are you familiar with the term 'typo' (=a typing error)?",3,3
53292,7,"student: kung fu?? that sounds fun!  teacher: yeah well my daughter started doing it and has really got into it so i thought i'd try do some extra with her - so i can defend myself against her!    teacher: oh, absolutely! my daughter recently got into it and she's been so passionate about it. i figured i'd join her for some extra practice, you know, just in case i need to protect myself from her!",3,4
53293,7,"student: oh no, it's a mistake. i thought the verb was to tent, i`ll correct it thanks  teacher: ok sure - she hit me with her elbow the other day and it really hurt even though she's only 9    teacher: absolutely, no problem. interestingly enough, the other day, she accidentally hit me with her elbow, and surprisingly, it really hurt, despite her being just 9 years old.",3,3
53294,7,"student: haha did she hit you by accident??  teacher: no! we were play fighting - but she takes it quite seriously hahah the tricky thing is as a parent i feel like i have to lose you know? but..at the same time i have to try to get her to cope with failure!    teacher: actually, we were just play fighting. it's funny because she gets really into it. the challenging part is that as a parent, i feel like i have to let her win, you know? but at the same time, i want to teach her how to handle failure.",3,4
53295,7,"student: sure, i guess that is a difficult situation as a parent. i believe that it's not very helpful for children when parents let them win all the time but i'm not a mum  teacher: no i think you're right - i guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children i think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? compettive i mean competitive! learn the hard way = learn through bad experiences in case you weren't sure by the way    teacher: absolutely, i agree with you. it seems that children with siblings often learn this lesson through difficult experiences. however, for only children, it's crucial for them to experience loss at times. by the way, did you participate in any competitive sports in the past?",3,3
53296,7,"student: no, i've never played any sport as a team (i don't know how to say that)  teacher: you can say 'as part of a team' or 'in a team' or 'team sport' - all with the verb play    teacher: you can use phrases like 'as part of a team', 'in a team', or 'team sport' when referring to playing sports collaboratively.",3,2
53297,7,"student: great  teacher: but not 'as a team' just for yourself!    teacher: however, remember that this is an individual task, not a group effort.",3,1
53298,7,"student: i understand  teacher: i sed to play a lot of football but then 'retired' cos of injuries and now i just run but actually i've really got into it and run races etc used to play    teacher: i used to be heavily involved in football, but due to injuries, i decided to step back. now, i primarily focus on running, and surprisingly, i have developed a passion for it. i even participate in races and other running events.",4,3
53299,7,"student: i wish i had but i wasn't interested in team sports when i was younger  teacher: yeah some kids just don't - for different reasons i guess    teacher: it seems that not all kids are drawn to team sports, and there can be various reasons for that.",3,2
53300,7,"student: running is very popular in spain at the moment  teacher: yeah? in the uk too i'd say....there are lots of 'park runs' everywhere every saturday and people just turn up and do a 5k - i go to the athletics club so a bit more than average....    teacher: interesting! the uk is also caught up in the running craze. we have these amazing 'park runs' happening every saturday where people gather to complete a 5k. personally, i go the extra mile by being a part of an athletics club.",3,3
53301,7,"student: i think it's great! i can see much more people exercising on the streets nowadays than a few years ago  teacher: yes, you know one thing that i think about with running and spain is that it must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?) when i lived there i didn't do much exercise - just smoked and drank too much! i gave up smoking a long time ago by the way thank god...    teacher: absolutely! running in spain can be quite challenging during the hotter months, don't you think? it can get too hot to run comfortably. back when i lived there, i wasn't very active myself. i used to smoke and drink excessively. by the way, i'm grateful to say that i quit smoking a long time ago, thank goodness.",4,2
53302,7,"student: yes, i think you are right. i'm not sure if runners keep running in summer time... i don't know if you know that in the canary islands it is generally 22 degrees all the year round (is it correct?) so we don't have that problem  teacher: oh yes of course i forgot about that ...perfect! you can say: 'all year round' without 'the'    teacher: ah, i completely overlooked that fact... excellent! you can simply say: 'all year round' instead of 'the'.",3,3
53303,7,"student: haha i see that your experience in spain wasn't to healthy but i guess it was very fun thanks for corrections  teacher: it was fun yeah! nice food cheap fags and booze so at the time i loved it!    teacher: it was definitely a fun time! the food was delicious, and everything was so affordable. i indulged in some vices, but back then, i thoroughly enjoyed it!",3,2
53304,7,"student: fags and booze?? i don't know these words  teacher: yeah i guessed you might not - i sued them deliberately sorry...they're informal ways of saying cigarettes and alcohol (in that order)!    teacher: ah, i had a feeling you might not be - i intentionally used those words, my apologies... they're more casual expressions for cigarettes and alcohol (in that order)!",3,2
53305,7,"student: how long did you live in spain? (do i need to add 'for' at the end of the question?) haha fun words  teacher: no you don't need to add 'for' i was there for 3 years (with a 12-month break in the middle in france)    teacher: no, 'for' is not necessary. i actually lived there for 3 years (with a 12-month break in france).",3,3
53306,7,"student: woww 3 years is a lot  teacher: by the way the fags one is more lower class than the booze one i'd say...    teacher: just a side note, the cigarette option is generally considered less expensive than the alcohol option, in my opinion.",1,2
53307,7,"student: did you teach english all the time?  teacher: yes i was still teaching it was 20 years or so ago now    teacher: indeed, i used to teach english. it was quite a while back, around 20 years ago.",3,3
53308,7,"student: i just looked up the word fag in the dictionary and the first meaning is 'gay in an offensive way' (i didn't know that meaning either). the second meaning is cigarettes.  teacher: yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! i'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more american than british    teacher: indeed, that information is accurate! interestingly, when we use the term, we usually don't associate it with the other meaning. i would say that using 'fag' as an insult for 'gay' is more common in american english rather than british english.",3,4
53309,7,student: i'm not sure about how to use 'look up'... can i say 'i look up fag in the dictionary...'??  teacher: yes you were right! it was correct    teacher: absolutely! you were correct in your understanding.,3,2
53310,7,student: ok thanks  teacher: what else would you say?    teacher: is there anything else you would like to add?,2,1
53311,7,"student: about look up??  teacher: yes    teacher: of course, i would be happy to help you with that.",2,2
53312,7,"student: i looked up the sky and i saw...??  teacher: oh, yes of course ....no i meant for the meaning of look up something in the dictionary etc...but it's ok - that's exactly the phrasal verb you need - i just wanted to check you weren't using something else that was wrong sometimes    teacher: ah, absolutely! actually, what i meant was to search for a word in the dictionary and such. however, don't worry - that's precisely the phrasal verb you require. i just wanted to ensure you weren't using a different one that could be incorrect at times.",3,3
53313,7,"student: ahh i see i checked the word in the dictionary ??  teacher: yes that's fine too - would you say 'search' ?    teacher: absolutely, that works as well - would you use 'search' ?",3,2
53314,7,"student: not sure. i don't say it but i don't know if it is right i search on the internet  teacher: no that's good - just wanted to check - lots of non-natives use 'search' a lot now because of the internet of course - it's fine for that but they use it too much for other things you see - look up and check = perfect    teacher: that's actually great! i just wanted to confirm. many non-native speakers heavily rely on 'search' due to the internet, which is understandable. however, they tend to overuse it for various purposes. in your case, looking up and verifying is absolutely perfect.",3,3
53315,7,"student: ok  teacher: by the way do you use the internet much to keep up your english? e.g. youtube ..or netflix or something    teacher: oh, i was just curious if you utilize the internet often to enhance your english skills. maybe through platforms like youtube or netflix?",3,2
53316,7,"student: yes, i try to watch things in english. i listen to bbc radio podcasts, ted talks, i watch series... my idea is to take the cambridge advanced exam in february so i have to work on it everyday... it's hard thoug +though  teacher: yeah that's great - there's so much now right? i've really noticed the effect on the average level of my students, especially the younger ones - they've picked up so much from the internet etc - that's great about cae - it's good to have a set goal i guess...    teacher: wow, that's fantastic! there are so many resources available now, right? it's amazing how much my students, especially the younger ones, have improved thanks to the internet and such. having a specific goal like cae is really commendable...",3,3
53317,7,"student: yes, the internet is great for that!  teacher: sorry small thing <student> - earlier you said (i think) something like 'i also do a lot of exercise' - is there a difference in your mind between 'also' and e.g. too/as well'    teacher: my apologies, <student>, but i recall you mentioning earlier that you do a lot of exercise. i'm curious, do you perceive any distinction between using 'also' versus 'too' or 'as well'?",3,2
53318,7,"student: what do you mean by 'a difference in your mind'? are you asking me if i know how to use them all??  teacher: which one is more formal of the three?    teacher: out of the three options, which one would be considered more formal?",3,3
53319,7,"student: i don't know!!  teacher: also' is more formal - to the extent that it's a little bit weird to hear: 'i also...' in everyday sepaking. it's not a big deal! and something shared by probably about 99.9% of non-native speakers to be honest.....    teacher: ""also"" is actually a more formal word. it's a bit unusual to hear ""i also..."" in casual conversation. but don't worry, it's not a big deal! in fact, almost all non-native speakers make this mistake.",3,2
53320,7,"student: really?? for me it doesn't sound formal at all.  teacher: it's more normal at the start of a sentence to introduce another point you see? like: i'm going because it's fun. also, i want to see my friends etc    teacher: typically, when starting a sentence, it's more common to introduce another point. for example, ""i'm going because it's fun."" additionally, i want to see my friends, and so on.",3,3
53321,7,"student: i love learning this kind of things... i find it funny the way we understand a language when we studied it.  teacher: but the person answering wouldn't say: i also want to see my friends - they'd say (the native speaker!) : i want to see my friends too/as well... yes there's loads of littel things little    teacher: however, a native speaker wouldn't respond with ""i also want to see my friends"" but rather ""i want to see my friends too/as well..."" there are many small details like this to consider.",3,2
53322,7,"student: i understand, very interesting  teacher: i'm sure you picked loads of authentic tuff from living in the uk well you have - i can see that picked up loads of stuff i meant!    teacher: i have no doubt that your time in the uk has exposed you to a wealth of genuine knowledge. it's evident that you have gained a great deal of valuable information. i meant to say that you have acquired a plethora of knowledge!",4,3
53323,7,"student: sure!! by living there i realised how different it is learning a language at school in your own country from learning in the country (ohh i don't know how to say this) how different is to learn...  teacher: no that's fine! you were right the first time! ok thanks <student> i guess we'll stop there - i'll email you in a bit ok?    teacher: that's perfect! you had it right the first time! alright, thank you <student>. i suppose we can end the discussion here - i'll send you an email shortly, alright?",3,2
53324,7,"student: ok, thank your very much again good bye!  teacher: ok thanks a lot bye    teacher: alright, i appreciate it. take care!",3,1
53326,70,"student: good afternoon <teacher>.    student: hey there, <teacher>. how's it going?",3,2
53327,70,"teacher: hi there <student>, how's it going?  student: yes... i just feel tired when when want to study massive new knowledge. it is difficult to see improvement of myself. because they all hard for me,.    student: well, to be honest, i'm feeling quite exhausted when it comes to tackling all this new information. it's been a real challenge for me to see any progress because everything seems so difficult.",3,3
53328,70,"teacher: ok...you mean you feel overwhelmed by the huge task in front of you? you mean improving your english? or other things? python??!  student: yes... including improving my english. i also spend a long time for each new knowledge that over-break my abilities.    student: indeed, i do feel overwhelmed, especially when it comes to improving my english. additionally, i find myself spending a significant amount of time on each new concept, which often surpasses my current abilities.",3,3
53329,70,"teacher: yes i see,,,it can seem very hard i know... it is a long process...you've just got to keep going step by step and have faith that you are improving (you are!) and try to enjoy the process don't think about a 'finish line'  student: yes...i really enjoy the whole process when i am studying new knowledge. but sometime i feel unhappy.    teacher: i understand. learning can be challenging and it's normal to feel frustrated at times. remember that progress takes time and it's important to take it one step at a time. have confidence in your abilities and know that you are improving. instead of focusing on the end result, try to find joy in the journey.",4,2
53330,70,teacher: yes...can you set yourself small achievable goals?  student: because i also forget many knowledge.    student: it's just that i tend to forget a lot of what i learn.,2,1
53331,70,"teacher: the problem sometimes is that you have no way to measure your progress you see?  student: yes.. i thinks so, i just keep studying...    student: absolutely, i find myself constantly studying to improve.",3,2
53332,70,"teacher: yes, well you won't remember everything the first time you know? you have to lean something many times before you really remember it - that's normal yuu had to do that at the beginning too - you've just forgotten  student: i perceive it is may a long process.    student: i understand that it might be a lengthy journey.",3,2
53333,70,"teacher: also, remember <student> that memorising words and then trying to 'test' your memory is not easy - what really matters is that you can use the language you're studying you know? but for example, the changes you made to your use of tenses last week was a big step  student: thanks for youencourage me    student: i really appreciate your encouragement. thank you.",3,3
53334,70,teacher: it might not feel that way but any english speaker reading/listening to your correct present perfect/past simple or going to/will examples would notice a big difference ok fine!  student: thanks very much.    student: i greatly appreciate your assistance.,3,2
53335,70,"teacher: ok <student> - let's have a quick practice of past/future ok? tell me 5 things you did at the weekend if you can ok?  student: yes, after we finished class, i reviewed the stuffs which i studied in class, and on saturday, i watched the videos that are 'coursera' curriculums, and on sunday i made next week's studying plans, everything seems like on the correct track. however, in the morning when i watched videos of coursers i also felt unhappy, because they are hard to understood whatever in listening or reading, and after today's class i am going to review those videos again. actually, i really think that doing something new at the beginning is really difficult.    student: of course! after class, i took some time to review the material we covered. on saturday, i dedicated some time to watching educational videos on coursera. then, on sunday, i planned out my study schedule for the upcoming week. it feels like i'm on the right track. however, i must admit that while watching the coursera videos in the morning, i felt a bit frustrated. they were challenging to understand, both in terms of listening and reading. after today's class, i plan to revisit those videos and review them again. it's just that starting something new can be quite difficult, you know?",3,3
53336,70,teacher: ok thanks <student> for all that ... hold on asec  student: seemed like - i forgot to use past simple here.    student: it appears that i neglected to use the past simple tense in that sentence.,3,2
53337,70,"teacher: yes ok got it! yes so...correct past simple verbs here and also a nice 'going to' for plans = great! so now i think i understand a bit more why you feel a bit down about your english! you have to remember <student> that the videos on coursera are not designed for non-natives - they would be hard for most students also, you an't expect to understand everything...did you understand the main idea in the videos? can't expect i mean  student: yes.. and another thing i am unhappy is that our class ending on wednesday.    student: yes, and another aspect that's bothering me is that our class is ending on wednesday.",4,3
53338,70,"teacher: yes i can understand that - it was quite a routine i can imagine...  student: yes.. for example, the video required me finish the task on 20 minutes, but it also takes me 1 or 2 hours to understand. required me to    student: absolutely! it's frustrating because the video expects me to complete the task in 20 minutes, but it actually takes me 1 or 2 hours to fully comprehend.",3,4
53339,70,"teacher: ok i see ... that is quite ambitious - perhaps you should try something a bit easier?  student: but.. until now, i really fell my english have been have improving while i am studying with you, i really enjoy the time that i am studying online with you. have been improved    student: i must say, i have noticed significant progress in my english since i started studying with you. i genuinely appreciate the time i spend learning online with you.",3,4
53340,70,"teacher: feel has been improving also possible  student: haha.... i am not sure why i repeated the sentences.....    student: haha... i must admit, i'm not entirely sure why i felt the need to restate those sentences.",2,3
53341,70,"teacher: that's ok - important thing is it's not past simple ok <student> - shall we try a completely new topic to just get going and forget about these problems  student: yes.. i am ready.    student: absolutely, i'm all set.",3,2
53342,70,"teacher: ok ... i've just made some material on the topic of space (spending on space exploration ) ... why don't you tell me some words that you think might be useful to include in an essay on this topic? give me three to start if you can ok? anything that comes to mind!  student: one of the most .... another reason why....is that advantageous and disadvantageous effects obviously for instance    student: firstly, additionally, positive and negative impacts clearly, for example",2,3
53343,70,teacher: ok thanks <student>... so these phrase could definitely be useful in a lot of different essays that's true.....hold on.... these phrases  student: ok in my opinion    student: alright from my perspective,2,2
53344,70,teacher: ok let me use one of your phrases and ask you to finish it ok? 'another reason why we should spend money on space exploration is that...' a quick idea if possible!  student: ......is that human is not isolation in space. i am sure.. not sure    student: ...it helps to foster human connection beyond our planet. i believe... i'm uncertain.,3,3
53345,70,teacher: ok thanks ... 'isolation' = nice word.... you mean that there is life on other planets?  student: yes    student: indeed.,3,1
53346,70,teacher: ok undestood! so can you change your sentence to show that this just a possibility?  student: human want to spend millions on search of aline life.    student: it's possible that humans may invest millions in the pursuit of extraterrestrial life.,4,3
53347,70,"teacher: ok thanks ... 'spend millions on searching for alien life' = good sentence yes! do you think this is a good idea? do you think we should spend this money?  student: yes, i agree with it. because it can make human aware we are not alone wise specie in space.    student: absolutely, i concur. it has the potential to broaden our understanding of the universe and remind humanity that we are not the only intelligent species in existence.",4,4
53348,70,teacher: ok so .... going back to the idea that you say you are not sure there is life on other planets.... do you remember talking about rolling the dice and getting a double six? this is 'unl_ _ _ _ _ _ '??  student: unlikely unlikely    student: improbable improbable,3,2
53349,70,teacher: ok well remembered! so you think that it is __________ that alien life exists.?  student: it is likely that alien life exists.    student: i do think it's quite probable that alien life exists.,3,3
53350,70,"teacher: ok great ... so a good topic sentence could be: 'one reason why i think we should spend money on space exploration is that it is likely that alien life exists.' ok?  student: yes, it is more clearly.    student: absolutely, that statement is much more precise.",3,2
53351,70,"teacher: ok ... what could you say in a paragraph like this? i mean, why is it good to find alien life? remeember the stupid person? the stupid person would say: ok fine maybe there is life but so what? why should i pay tax to try to find it??  student: because we can move our attention from money to another things, such as arts since arts and sience. science    student: by exploring the possibility of alien life, we can shift our focus from monetary concerns to other areas, like the arts and sciences. the arts and sciences can both benefit from this exploration.",4,3
53352,70,teacher: you mean as a result of finding alien life?  student: which have values can show to alien.    student: is there a way to express our values to aliens?,3,2
53353,70,"teacher: ok so you mean finding alien life would inspire us to change our behaviour? ok i see what you mean...  student: yes,, i think if we just focus on money or daily problems, we may become more materialism.    student: absolutely! in my opinion, if we were to divert our attention solely towards financial pursuits and everyday issues, we might inadvertently foster a culture of materialism.",3,3
53354,70,teacher: materialistic = the adjective you need here (good word)  student: yes... i think it is a strange idea...    student: hmm... i find it to be quite an unusual concept...,3,2
53355,70,"teacher: are there any arguments in favour of spending money on space exploration which might be easier to explain?  student: i think if i disagree with this idea is more easily to explain.    student: personally, i find it easier to explain why i disagree with this idea.",2,3
53356,70,"teacher: oh sorry <student> - can you hold that though t and tell me after the break ok? ok i see your point there...we'l c ome back to it ok? bye for now..  student: yes,, see you    student: absolutely, i'll see you later.",3,1
53358,154,"teacher: hi <student>!    teacher: hello there, <student>! how are you doing today?",3,1
53359,154,"student: hello, <teacher>. nice to meet you!  teacher: hi, nice to speak to you again :) we only really say 'nice to meet you' the first time we meet a person. after that, it's 'nice to see you' or 'nice to speak to you' (over the phone / chat, if you don't really see the person) did you have a good weekend? was there a good game on?    teacher: hey, it's good to catch up with you again :) we usually use 'nice to meet you' when we first meet someone. but after that, it's more appropriate to say 'nice to see you' or 'nice to speak to you' (especially if it's over the phone or chat). how was your weekend? did you get a chance to watch any exciting games?",4,3
53360,154,"student: ok. nice to speak to you too.  teacher: lovely, nice to speak to you too :)    teacher: wonderful, it's great to speak with you too! :)",2,1
53361,154,"student: yes. saturday had a game, but i had some work to do, so i didn't watch the live game.  teacher: oh, that's a shame! there ___ a game ___ saturday what goes in the gaps?    teacher: ah, what a pity! there was indeed a game on saturday. what kept you from catching it?",3,3
53362,154,"student: there was a game on saturday.  teacher: yes, well done! and did you find anything interesting in the bookshop?    teacher: oh, that's fantastic! great job! by the way, did you happen to discover anything intriguing at the bookshop?",3,2
53363,154,student: i took my own books to the bookshop.  teacher: oh really? why?    teacher: interesting! may i ask why you did that?,3,3
53364,154,"student: there is a coffee house. i often go to the coffee house to read books.  teacher: oh, sounds really nice! what are you reading at the moment?    teacher: oh, that sounds absolutely delightful! i'm curious, what book has captured your attention lately?",4,3
53365,154,"student: people can read their own books, also can read the books in the bookshop.  teacher: your bookshop sounds like a lovely place    teacher: your bookshop seems like a delightful destination.",3,2
53366,154,"student: i'm reading a mathmathic book about machine learning.  teacher: ok! i wouldn't be able to read a book like this :)    teacher: oh, wow! that's quite impressive. i don't think i could handle a book like that myself.",3,3
53367,154,"student: in china, bookshops always have a coffee house to let peple have good reading time.  teacher: i had a nice weekend. my son and i decorated a christmas tree and watched a christmas movie and my husband made some lovely food what a good idea! i've realized i probably never went to a proper bookshop like this when we lived in shanghai, because i don't speak chinese    what an intriguing concept! it just dawned on me that during our time in shanghai, i may have missed out on the chance to visit a charming bookshop like this, simply because i don't speak chinese.",2,2
53368,154,"student: sounds great!  teacher: but we enjoyed a local dvd shop there :) ok, <student>, shall we have a look at b2 writing part 2?    teacher: however, we had a wonderful time exploring a nearby dvd shop :) alright, <student>, shall we dive into b2 writing part 2?",3,1
53369,154,"student: ok.  teacher: the word count for part 2 is the same as for part 1 (140-190 words), but you can choose your task out of 3 options all tasks in part 2 are imaginary / pretend situations. for example, write an article for an english magazine or write to your english-speaking friend not a real magazine and not a real friend, just an imaginary situation    teacher: in part 2, the word count remains the same as part 1, ranging from 140 to 190 words. however, you have the freedom to select one task out of three options. it's important to note that all tasks in part 2 are based on imaginary or pretend situations. for instance, you may be asked to write an article for an english magazine or compose a letter to an english-speaking friend. remember, these scenarios are not real, but rather designed to stimulate your creativity and language skills.",3,2
53370,154,"student: ok.  teacher: but, depending on the situation, your writing has to be a bit different. for example, if it's an email to a friend, you probably want to start with 'hi &lt;friend's name&gt;.' and end with 'best wishes, <student>' or something like that and if it's an article, you don't have to do any of these, you basically write an essay just like in part 1, it's important to answer all the questions that the task gives you    teacher: however, it's crucial to adapt your writing style based on the situation. for instance, when writing an email to a friend, it's preferable to begin with a friendly greeting like 'hi &lt;friend's name&gt;.' then, conclude with a closing like 'best wishes, <student>' or something similar. on the other hand, if you're working on an article, you can disregard these conventions and essentially write an essay. similar to part 1, it's essential to address all the questions provided in the task.",3,3
53371,154,student: ok.  teacher: have you got that pdf with writing tasks that i sent you earlier?    teacher: did you manage to receive the pdf i sent you earlier? it contains some writing tasks.,3,1
53372,154,"student: yes. i'm reading the questions.  teacher: lovely! as you can see, the choice is a book review, an article and an informal email (to a friend)    teacher: fantastic! take a look at the options: a book review, an article, and an informal email (to a friend).",3,2
53373,154,"student: yes. so which one is better for me.  teacher: which one do you like best? i know you love books, but one thing to make sure of with a book review is being able to remember the name of the book, the characters and the author in english i think we might practise all of them, one at a time, if you'd like they are all very useful    teacher: well, it depends on your preferences. considering your love for books, it would be beneficial for you to focus on improving your ability to recall the book's title, characters, and author in english. however, practicing all types of reviews can be equally valuable. we can work on each one individually if you'd like. rest assured, they all have their own unique benefits.",3,4
53374,154,"student: ok. i think i need some time to remember the names in the book. so the first time i think i will not choose the book review.  teacher: ok, very wise i think! an article or an email then?    teacher: excellent decision, i must say! how about an article or an email instead?",3,3
53375,154,"student: ok. an article.  teacher: ok, the most useful thing you have ever learned! what do you think this thing can be?    teacher: wonderful! share with me the most enlightening lesson you've acquired! any ideas on what this invaluable lesson might be?",3,4
53376,154,"student: sorry. i dont have a clear idea about this topic. some characters? like honest, brave?  teacher: no worries, let me give you an example. no, just a useful skill you learned for example, when i was at school, i learned to touch type (type without looking). this is one of the most useful skills that i've learned, it has saved me so much time because i can type very fast    teacher: not to worry, i'll provide you with an illustration. actually, it's a valuable skill that you acquire. let me share an example from my own school days. i learned touch typing, which means typing without looking at the keyboard. this skill has proven to be incredibly useful as it has saved me a tremendous amount of time, allowing me to type at a rapid pace.",4,3
53377,154,"student: ok, i know.  teacher: or, when i was 4 years old, i learned to swim. it's one of the most useful things i've learned because when i fell in a pool i could swim out. also, it means i enjoy seaside holidays cooking, starting a campfire, riding a bike - all useful skills ok? what do you think? playing a musical instrument    teacher: you know, when i was just a little kid, i actually learned how to swim. it's been such a valuable skill for me because whenever i found myself in a pool, i could easily swim to safety. plus, it's made my beach vacations so much more enjoyable. not to mention, it's helped me with cooking, starting a campfire, and even riding a bike - all practical skills, you know? oh, and let's not forget about playing a musical instrument. what are your thoughts on that?",3,2
53378,154,"student: when i was at high school, i learned computer programming. this is one of the most useful skills that i've learned.  teacher: wonderful example, yes! you will need to explain why it's been so useful to you    teacher: that's an excellent point! could you elaborate on how it has specifically benefited you?",4,3
53379,154,"student: it helped me go deep in computer world, and changed my life. now i'm an engineer in a company.  teacher: and then, in the next paragraph, answer the question, who you learned it from yes, good!    teacher: moving forward, kindly address the question of who imparted this knowledge to you in the subsequent paragraph. well done!",3,2
53380,154,"student: this place 'who' is a real person or something like a website?  teacher: a real person! if it was a website or school, it would be 'where did you learn it from' but if there was no real person, you can just describe how you learned it    teacher: definitely a real person! if it were a website or institution, you would ask ""where did you learn it from."" however, if there was no real person involved, you can simply explain how you acquired the knowledge.",4,3
53381,154,"student: i learnt it from my old borther who was a video game developer.  teacher: ok, lovely. we say 'elder brother'    teacher: ah, i see. it's actually more appropriate to refer to him as your 'elder brother'.",4,2
53382,154,"student: ok.  teacher: because what's important here is not that he might be old, but that he is older than you and with brothers/sisters, we use 'elder' instead of 'older'    teacher: the crucial point to understand is that his age is not the main focus; rather, the emphasis lies in the fact that he is older than you. when referring to siblings, we use the term 'elder' instead of 'older'.",3,1
53383,154,"student: ok.  teacher: cool, is your brother still a video game developer? you can use the present tense if he is    teacher: that's interesting! does your brother still work as a video game developer? feel free to use the present tense if he is.",3,3
53384,154,"student: yes.  teacher: i learnt it from my elder brother, who is a video game developer. lovely, could you say a bit about why it is a useful skill?    teacher: i actually acquired this knowledge from my older brother, who happens to work as a video game developer. oh, would you mind sharing some insights on the practicality of this skill?",3,3
53385,154,"student: during the progress, it showed me how to use computer codes to build a virual world. and the most important thing is that learning to coding helps me get a good job.  teacher: ok, nice long sentences, a couple of problems here it showed me how...' what's 'it' in this sentence? maybe, my brother showed me...?    teacher: well done on your detailed explanation! just a small suggestion: in the sentence ""it showed me how..."", it would be clearer if you specify who or what showed you. for example, you could say ""my brother showed me...""",3,4
53386,154,"student: yes. my brother showed me ...  teacher: yes, good! ok, and could you put the second sentence in the past tense? what do you need to change?    teacher: excellent!alright, and can you transform the second sentence into the past tense? what modifications are necessary?",3,3
53387,154,"student: helps --&gt; helped  teacher: yes, well done!    teacher: absolutely fantastic!",3,2
53388,154,"student: get --&gt; got?  teacher: yes, correct! and also, learning to code, you need the infinitive 'to code'    teacher: absolutely! you're on the right track!additionally, it's important to use the infinitive form ""to code"" when learning coding.",3,3
53389,154,"student: ok.  teacher: some other things that might be good to write about are, how old you were when you learned to code, whether it was hard to learn, whether you liked or not things like that because you need a nice 140-190-word article :)    teacher: it would be beneficial to include additional topics in your writing, such as your age when you acquired coding skills, the level of difficulty you experienced during the learning process, and your personal preference towards coding. these aspects will contribute to a well-rounded article of 140-190 words.",3,2
53390,154,student: ok.  teacher: would you like to try one more sentence?    teacher: how about giving another sentence a try?,3,1
53391,154,"student: ok. i learnt to code when i was at high school. it was hard to start, because you need to let yourself think like a computer. but when my elder brother taught me how to use computer language to build a tiny game, i thought i really like these things, and i would be a coder in the future.  teacher: this is excellent work, <student>!    teacher: well done, <student>! your effort and progress are truly commendable!",3,4
53392,154,student: thanks.  teacher: one small thing: i thought i really liked those things and i would be a coder in the future you need everything in the past    teacher: just a small note: i used to have a strong interest in those things and i had aspirations of becoming a coder in the past. it's important to include everything in the past tense.,4,2
53393,154,student: ok.  teacher: and maybe 'i really liked doing it' would be clearer than 'these things'    teacher: perhaps using 'i thoroughly enjoyed it' would provide more clarity compared to 'those activities'.,3,1
53394,154,"student: yes.  teacher: ok, lovely. as you can guess, the homework will be to write the whole article if you have the time. feel free to use the sentences you wrote today!    teacher: great! for your homework, i would suggest writing the entire article if you have the opportunity. you're more than welcome to incorporate the sentences you worked on today!",3,2

53399,27,"student: ahahah yes easy one  teacher: yes! ok <student> so....like we said i'll just ask you some part 3 style questions and you can answer as if you were speaking ok? try to say at least a couple of things about each quesrtion (e.g. a reason/example or whjatever) and i'll wait for you to finish...ok first question coming up    teacher: absolutely! alright, <student>, let's proceed with some part 3 style questions. take your time to answer each question thoroughly. feel free to provide reasons or examples for each response. i'll patiently wait for you to finish. alright, here comes the first question.",3,2
53400,27,"student: ok  teacher: ok so the topic is 'work' and question: is job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?'    teacher: alright, let's dive into the topic of 'work'. our question for today is: does job satisfaction outweigh salary when it comes to choosing a job?",3,3
53401,27,"student: i believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy, it would be difficult for you to be happy it's important to do a work that we can enjoy because it will be our main occupation during the day  teacher: ok thanks <student>...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean    teacher: thank you for sharing your perspective, <student>. perhaps it would be helpful to provide an example to further illustrate your point. for instance, consider a job that lacks enjoyment, and how that would impact one's overall satisfaction.",3,2
53402,27,"student: that's the reason why after the hight school it would be better to make a councious (i know thespelling is wrong) decision you mean for example subject?  teacher: ok thanks so good more normal here) ...hold on...    teacher: absolutely. so, when we say ""good,"" we're referring to a high salary and a career that takes up most of our time.",3,1

53404,27,student: ah ok  teacher: because it gives you a chance to use more detailed language you see    teacher: it's actually quite beneficial as it allows you to incorporate more intricate language into your writing.,3,3
53405,27,"student: for example a business man had a lot of responsabilities but it's depend from the people depends  teacher: and it's not enjoyable as a result? because it's...? stressful for example?    teacher: so, does that mean it's not exactly a pleasurable experience? is it more along the lines of being stressful, perhaps?",3,2
53406,27,"student: for some people being a doctor can be not enjoyable because life of young people and adults depend from him lifes  teacher: ok thanks some specific examples often good idea - hold on a sec <student>, look at following and make a change if you can: you said: i believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy... are the two verb tenses ok here? by the way: spelling good for plural    teacher: thank you for sharing your perspective. it would be helpful to provide specific examples to support your point. also, let's take a moment to review your statement: ""i believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy..."" are the verb tenses used correctly in this sentence? additionally, please note that the correct spelling is 'conscious' and 'responsibility'. instead of 'depend from', it would be more accurate to say 'depend on'. lastly, 'lives' is the correct plural form.",3,3
53407,27,student: the plural of life is lives??  teacher: yes!    teacher: absolutely!,3,1

53410,27,"student: we don't know ah but are you waitlist ting for me? waiting  teacher: er yes sorry ...for the verb tense question...and depend 'from' ?    teacher: um, yes, my apologies...for the question about verb tense...and it depends on 'from'...right?",2,2
53411,27,student: sorry depend by  teacher: no worrries! on on on on on on on on !!!    teacher: don't worry about it! let's focus and work together.,2,3

53417,27,"student: maybe... ahaha yes i mean 'too' in an italian way  teacher: yes we can never be sure....ok <student> you used 'had' and don't enjoy' - is this ok in one conditional sentence?    teacher: it's difficult to say for certain....alright, <student>, you utilized 'had' and 'don't enjoy' - is this acceptable in a single conditional sentence?",3,2
53418,27,"student: it's depends on what comes after or before the past with would the present with will  teacher: well no not really because you can't switch between 1st and 2nd because it's either real or not real you see    teacher: actually, that's not entirely accurate. you cannot interchange between the first and second conditionals because they represent either reality or non-reality, you understand?",3,3
53419,27,"student: ahhh sure  teacher: so if you say 'had' you have to follow it with ...? don't or didn't?    teacher: let's clarify this rule. when using 'had', should we use 'don't' or 'didn't' after it?",3,2
53420,27,"student: didn't  teacher: ok good! you can switch between 2nd and 3rd because this is about time you see?    teacher:alright, that's alright!you have the flexibility to switch between 2nd and 3rd person because it relates to the concept of time, you know?",3,1
53421,27,"student: and then i must use would  teacher: yes exactly    teacher: precisely, that's correct.",2,1
53422,27,"student: i see when i can use the mixed one?  teacher: ok next question if you're ready: whcat skills are need to get a good job these days? ah hold on are needed' sorry hold on hold on    teacher: alright, let's move on to the next question when you're ready: what skills are essential for securing a good job in today's world? oh, just a moment. it should be 'are needed', my apologies. hold on for a moment, please.",2,1
53423,27,"student: leadership  teacher: well for example: i would be rich (now so 2nd) if i had studied medicine (in the past so 3rd) ok?    teacher: let me give you an example: if i had pursued medicine in the past, i would be financially well-off by now. do you understand?",2,2
53424,27,"student: can i say 'if i studied medicine i would be rich'? i never understand the difference  teacher: if you mean you 're imagining beginning to study medicine now then yes the if i had studied = i didn't study it but if i had .....(often a regret you know?) you understand 'regret' right ? like i wish i had/hadn't but i didn't    teacher: if you're referring to the idea of starting to study medicine at this moment, then yes. the phrase ""if i had studied"" implies that i did not actually study it, but if i had, it would be accompanied by regret. do you comprehend the concept of ""regret""? it's like wishing you had or hadn't done something, even though you didn't.",3,3
53425,27,"student: ah so if i'm a babysitter and i had already done the main decision of my life i have to use the 3rd, right? yes regret  teacher: yes exactly...so i wish i wasn't a babysitter (now) i wish i had studied medicine or whatever in the past    teacher: precisely... if only i hadn't chosen to be a babysitter (now), i wish i had pursued medicine or something else in the past.",4,2
53426,27,student: because i can't change the things now  teacher: yes exactly!    teacher: that's correct!,2,1
53427,27,student: ahhhhh thanks  teacher: so 3rd = unreal past and 2nd = unreal present/future    teacher: let's discuss the usage of 3rd for unreal past and 2nd for unreal present/future.,4,3
53428,27,"student: thanks a lot  teacher: ok no problem - <student> keep going with the skills if you're ready the skills question i mean    teacher: of course, it's my pleasure. whenever you're ready, continue practicing your skills. specifically, focus on the skills question.",3,2
53429,27,student: yes i am  teacher: ok... you ok? you mentioned 'leadership'....? sorry if you're typing i'll wait...    teacher: alright... are you feeling alright? i noticed you mentioned 'leadership'....? take your time if you're still typing...,2,3
53430,27,"student: according to me one of the most significant skills to get a job is leadership because without this one it's impossible to.... i dont know how explain in italian neither do not be submissive?  teacher: ha! well i guess that 'leadership skills' are only really essential in some jobs right ?    teacher: oh, i see. so you believe that leadership skills are important for most job roles, right?",3,4
53431,27,"student: it's not the exactly word  teacher: um...you mean self-confidence maybe?    teacher: ah, so you're thinking more along the lines of self-assurance, perhaps?",3,2
53432,27,"student: i think in the majority of them yes good idea  teacher: yes i think this makes more sense (certainly to my english brain) a common idea (and good)    teacher: i agree, this approach seems more logical (at least from my perspective as a native english speaker). it's a popular and beneficial idea.",4,3
53433,27,"student: in my italian brain too  teacher: maybe more of a quality than a skills but don't worry too much! ok any other ideas?    teacher: perhaps it's more of a unique trait rather than a skill, but there's no need to stress about it! alright, do you have any other suggestions?",2,2
53434,27,"student: let me think  teacher: ok...i'll wait!    teacher: of course, take your time. i'm here patiently waiting.",4,1
53435,27,"student: another remarkable ability could be having knowledge about a specific area of study  teacher: ok....when you say 'remarkable' you mean...?    teacher: ah, i see. so, when you mention 'remarkable', what exactly do you mean by that?",3,2
53436,27,"student: important  teacher: ah ok - that's better or e.g. valuable maybe? so 'specialist knowledge' = good phrase here ok?    teacher: ah, i see - that's an improvement. perhaps we can use the term 'expertise' instead? it might be more fitting in this context, don't you think?",4,3
53437,27,student: yes  teacher: always good to give specific example if possible so...can you think of a particular area?    teacher: it's great to hear your willingness to provide specific examples. is there a particular area that comes to mind?,3,2
53438,27,"student: for example a person graduated in economy will have more chance to be hired than another person without a degree in a specific company  teacher: ok thanks so...a candidate for a job with a degree in economics will have more chance of being hired than... fine or e.g. more likely to be hired = also possible    teacher: excellent point! so, it's safe to say that a candidate with an economics degree has a higher likelihood of being selected for a job. additionally, we can also consider the possibility of them being more likely to be hired.",3,3
53439,27,"student: so good so better  teacher: thanks! ok <student> we'll have to stop in a minute but...good skills to mention might include e.g. communication skills/it skills etc    teacher: thank you! alright, <student>, we'll need to wrap up soon but...some valuable skills to consider mentioning are communication skills and it skills, among others.",3,2
53440,27,"student: yes  teacher: because they're related to the world of work nowadays do you see?    teacher: it's quite evident that these topics have a strong connection to the current professional landscape, wouldn't you agree?",3,1
53441,27,"student: languages yes i see  teacher: yes good example! give me a sentence with that one if you like    teacher: that's an excellent point! if you'd like, feel free to provide a sentence using that language.",3,2
53442,27,"student: which one  teacher: languages... cos it was your idea!    teacher: we should consider exploring different languages, as it was your suggestion!",3,3
53443,27,"student: it's also important to develop languages skills to improve the communication with other agencies and colleagues  teacher: ok thanks! 'colleagues'/'develop skills' 'important to' = all good! not 'the' though    teacher:great! thank you for mentioning the significance of developing skills in language and the importance of effective communication with colleagues. just a small note, avoid using ""the"" in this context.",3,2
53444,27,"student: yes sorry  teacher: that's ok! we'll call it a day i guess thanks <student> see you tomorrow....    teacher: no problem at all! let's wrap it up for today. thank you, <student>. see you tomorrow!",3,1

53805,168,teacher: hi <student>!  student: hello <teacher>! i'm sorry for being late    student: hi <teacher>. sorry for being late.,2,1
53806,168,teacher: no worries :)  student: i had a class of russian with a student and he was half hour late (    student: i had a russian class with a student who was thirty minutes late.,3,3
53807,168,"teacher: oh no! was it an online class?  student: yes. it was in skype he's in germany and forgot about the time difference    student: yeah, it was on skype. he's in germany, you know. and he totally forgot about the time difference.",3,4
53808,168,"teacher: i see! you certainly have an exciting job! (so do i i think :)  student: depends on the student))    student: well, it varies depending on the student.",3,2
53809,168,"teacher: i wouldn't even know where to start if i was teaching russian. i mean, russian / ukrainian words just change all the time  student: that was me 6 years ago)))    student: i can relate to that. it feels like a lifetime ago when i was in that position, six whole years ago.)))",3,3
53810,168,"teacher: well, i suppose this is the difference between a professional language teacher and a native speaker of the language  student: i also couldn't figure out how to do it i did my homework by the way right after our last lesson    student: i couldn't really grasp the concept either. oh, and just so you know, i managed to complete my homework. i did it immediately after our previous lesson.",2,2
53811,168,"teacher: oh lovely, i did the reading too :)  student: the task seemed pretty challenging    student: the task appeared to be quite difficult.",3,2
53812,168,"teacher: i've got the answer key, by the way, don't worry, i'm not just checking your answers against mine  student: it is actually one of my least favourite tasks no worries at all)))    student: honestly, this is one of the tasks i dislike the most. it's fine, no worries at all.",2,3
53813,168,"teacher: which one? the missing paragraphs one?  student: yours are as good as the answer keys yes, the missing paragraphs    student: your assignments are just as satisfactory as the answer keys. yes, it's the one about the missing paragraphs.",4,2
53814,168,"teacher: i wish! i got a couple wrong with the missing paragraphs! like you say, a tough task  student: this type gets extra difficult starting from the advanced level    student: as you mentioned, this particular type becomes even more difficult once you reach the advanced level.",3,3
53815,168,"teacher: the trouble is, if you get just the one wrong, you're likely to get at least one more wrong too because you might have already used the paragraph you needed  student: exactly    student: that's correct.",3,2
53816,168,"teacher: ok, shall we have a look?  student: yes! let me open the file ready ok. 37 d    student: sure, i guess. let me just open the file. i'm ready, i suppose. okay. 37 d.",2,3
53817,168,teacher: yes!  student: 38 h    student: 38 h,1,1

53823,168,"teacher: yaaaay!  student: wow    student: oh, cool.",3,2
53824,168,teacher: you did it!!!  student: i was 100 per cent sure something's wrong    student: i had a feeling that there might be an issue.,3,3
53825,168,"teacher: nope, you crushed it :)  student: wow #error! i'm happy    student: okay.",3,2
53826,168,"teacher: well done! you should be!  student: i do really hate those tasks though <another student> can tell you how i struggled while completing it    student: i really despise those assignments, you know. <another student> can share with you how i suffered through it.",2,3
53827,168,"teacher: haha, yes. my strategy when i was preparing for cpe was a lot of underlining with a pencil  student: i need to print it then    student: i guess i'll have to print it out then.",3,2
53828,168,"teacher: i would underline the words that link the two paragraphs (before and after)  student: yes! i do the same just in my head    student: yeah, i guess. i usually just do it in my head.",3,3
53829,168,"teacher: true! you also need to know whether your exam will be paper-based or computer-based because obviously, there's no use getting used to underlining in a computer-based exam  student: which one is more common?    student: so, which type of exam is more frequently used?",3,4
53830,168,"teacher: but i think a computer-based one allows you to drag-and-drop paragraphs, which can also be quite visually helpful i don't know what it's like in kyiv now! i sat the paper-based one, but it was, like 10 years ago now  student: that would be great if they do it    student: it would be nice if they implement such a feature.",3,3
53831,168,"teacher: it all depends on the exam centre and whether they have enough computers and which model they prefer  student: i see which center is the best for this type of exams? in your opinion    student: oh, i understand. so, in your opinion, which center would you consider the most suitable for these exams?",3,2
53832,168,"teacher: british council was the only one that offered cpe at the time, but grade might do it now too  student: now there are plenty    student: nowadays, there are quite a few options available.",2,2
53833,168,"teacher: it shouldn't matter, the exam experience should be the same across the world, this is the job of an exam centre  student: from what i've managed to find bc is the optimal choice i guess    student: i guess, based on what i've found, bc seems to be the best option.",2,2
53834,168,"teacher: and grade or the bc, you will probably get the same speaking examiners because there are very few examiners who are qualified to do cpe (<teacher's husband> used to do it) i liked the bc, they had a nice cafe :)  student: i see.    student: i understand.",2,1
53835,168,"teacher: the one in podil but like i say, they were the only option  student: oh nice. a cafe! that's a definitive pro for me    student: oh, great. a cafe. that's definitely a positive aspect for me.",3,2
53836,168,"teacher: a bit of useless trivia: one of the cpe examiners in kyiv is the wife of andrei kurkov, the writer  student: is he a famous writer?))    student: oh, really? is he considered to be well-known?))",3,3
53837,168,"teacher: i've never read him, to be honest! i keep meaning to. but i saw his books in english bookshops  student: so he writes in english?    student: oh, so he actually writes in english then?",3,2
53838,168,teacher: is he quite famous in kyiv?  student: never heard of him    student: i honestly have no knowledge of his existence.,2,1
53839,168,"teacher: hmm, i presume they are translations, but i might be wrong! his wife is english, so he might be bilingual  student: i'll look him up    student: i guess i'll search for him online.",2,2
53840,168,"teacher: this is what wiki has to say andrey yuryevich kurkov is a ukrainian novelist and an independent thinker who writes in russian. he is the author of 19 novels, including the bestselling death and the penguin, 9 books for children, and about 20 documentary, fiction and tv movie scripts. an independent thinker! :))  student: what a biography. did his wife compose it? ))))    student: wow, what a fascinating biography. i wonder if his wife had any involvement in composing it? ))))",3,3
53841,168,"teacher: i wonder that :))  student: interesting ))    student: it's somewhat intriguing, i suppose.",2,2
53842,168,"teacher: he's quite prolific it seems. amazon.uk is offering me lots of books by him, now that i've googled him :)  student: amazon follows you    student: it seems like amazon is constantly tracking your interests.",3,3
53843,168,teacher: definitely!  student: i saw a funny tik tok video couple of days ago    student: i guess i came across a mildly amusing tiktok video a few days ago.,2,2
53844,168,"teacher: oh, before we continue, i'll just mention that i'll take some time off (or more like <teacher's child> will be off starting from next week) and be back to chats from monday january 4. i do understand this is bang in the middle of the festive period for you, so do let me know whether you'd like a class on january 6 tik tok! you're way more social media savvy than me!  student: i saw it on ig ok sure! let's try the 6th    student: i saw it on instagram. alright, sure. let's give the 6th a try.",3,2
53845,168,"teacher: see, i don't even know what ig is :)  student: instagram    student: it's just instagram.",2,1
53846,168,"teacher: ah, ok! the gram :))  student: i hate tik tok actually    student: honestly, i really dislike tiktok.",2,2
53847,168,"teacher: ok, jan 6th! it's quite new, isn't it?  student: yes. the audiences there ... it's just sad.    student: yeah. the people who attend... it's just really depressing.",3,1
53848,168,"teacher: so is the idea that it's videos? like insta, but videos? why is it sad?  student: anyway, the video was about a wife after seeing her husband leaving his mobile phone on the table and going to the shower, takes the phone and talks to eat to it* very slowly she says buy flowers kyiv' 'buy new iphone 11 kyiv centre' 'beautiful roses kyiv; trying to train the search engines so that later they can show her husband a targeted ad    student: well, the video i watched was about a wife who, after noticing her husband leaving his phone on the table and heading to the shower, picks up the phone and starts talking to it. she speaks very slowly, saying things like ""buy flowers in kyiv,"" ""buy a new iphone 11 in kyiv center,"" and ""beautiful roses in kyiv."" her intention is to train the search engines so that they can later display targeted ads to her husband.",3,3
53849,168,"teacher: haha, oh goodness! now there's a new way to plant ideas into people's heads  student: smart, right? now you know how to plant a gift idea into <teacher's husband>'s head    student: quite clever, isn't it? now you possess the knowledge of how to implant a suggestion for a present in <teacher's husband>'s mind.",3,2
53850,168,"teacher: devious! haha, i just ask :)  student: i'll try it with <student's husband>. see if it works))    student: i suppose i could attempt it with my spouse. let's see if it yields any results))",3,3
53851,168,teacher: let me know!  student: asking is always better! sure for the sake of the experiment    student: it is preferable to inquire. i suppose so. just for the purpose of the experiment.,2,2
53852,168,teacher: in case he doesn't get the hint :)  student: <student's husband> is bad at hints he's bad even when i directly ask for something particular.    student: my husband is not very skilled at picking up hints. he struggles even when i explicitly request something specific.,2,3
53853,168,teacher: :))) oh no!  student: he just forgets what it was right away    student: he simply cannot retain the information.,2,2
53854,168,teacher: <student's child> will have to train him up  student: the mind of a simultaneous interpreter i guess    student: i suppose i'll have to learn about the complexities of being a simultaneous interpreter.,3,3
53855,168,"teacher: oh, true, he kind of clears the cash immediately?  student: <student's child> will persevere exactly. that's how i call it too    student: yeah, my kid will keep going, i guess. yeah, that's what i think too.",3,2
53856,168,"teacher: that's ___ i call it too  student: what )) sorry    student: huh? umm, my apologies.",2,1
53857,168,teacher: yes :) no worries! i know it's hard! it's still hard for me to think of hair as 'it' i have to make a conscious effort  student: old habits die hard    student: it's just difficult to break old habits.,4,3

53859,168,"teacher: die hard, i wonder if <teacher's husband>'s going to make me watch it this xmas. it's a xmas movie in the uk! yep!  student: i know. my sis just told me yesterday that they watched it together with her boyfriend and decorated the xtree    student: yeah, i heard. my sister mentioned that she and her boyfriend watched it and decorated the christmas tree.",3,3

53861,168,"teacher: well, the kiddie ones, like the grinch and christmas chronicles. love actually (soppy, i know!) and musicals (poor <teacher's husband>!)  student: love actually! my all-time favourite xmas movie    student: love actually is my absolute favorite christmas movie ever.",4,3

53867,168,"teacher: i know it's a bit weird to practise speaking in this format, but shall we have a go at a couple of speaking questions from cpe? c2 proficiency, i should say he is lovely, yes!  student: the way he grunts -- i just love it    student: i find his grunting noises oddly appealing.",3,3
53868,168,"teacher: he grunts?? maybe i do have to rewatch die hard :))  student: how about when this cambridge experiment's over and you have more free time, i'll take some extra lessons in skype to practise speaking and writing? meanwhile, we can continue with the test part of the exam?    student: what if, after this cambridge experiment concludes and you find yourself with an abundance of free time, i were to suggest the idea of taking additional lessons via skype to improve my speaking and writing skills? in the meantime, shall we proceed with the test portion of the exam?",3,4
53869,168,"teacher: ok sure, we can do that! even though writing is actually perfect for this format, i do it with other students would you like a writing homework for the xmas holiday? (i'm so good at xmas presents!)  student: oh. only speaking then, right. i would!    student: oh. just speaking, huh? yeah, i guess i would want that.",3,2
53870,168,"teacher: yes, c2 writing is tough and it pays to start early! the main reason it's tough is the time limit: 1 h 30 min to write two essays  student: i think for me speaking and writing will be tough really? 90 minutes? it is scary    student: i believe speaking and writing will be quite difficult for me. seriously? 90 whole minutes? it's honestly quite frightening.",3,3
53871,168,"teacher: well, you're fluent, so not too tough, but at c2 level you obviously aim to impress, not just speak and write  student: that's the problem ))    student: yeah, that's the issue.",3,2
53872,168,"teacher: yes, and each essay should be 280-320 words  student: anyway, what would you like me to write about? omg maybe passing this exam is not such a good idea after all)))))    student: whatever, what do you want me to write about? oh my gosh. maybe it's not a great idea to pass this exam, like, at all.",3,3
53873,168,"teacher: yes, that's another thing to think about in terms of computer-based / paper-based. if you type fast, a computer-based exam could give an advantage  student: i think it's more or less the same speed    student: i suppose the speed is more or less equal in both cases.",3,2
53874,168,"teacher: well, we can give it a go and practise! you didn't think you'd be good at reading and use of english, remember? there are two parts to a writing exam. you have no choice of task in part 1, but in part 2 there are a few options hold on a sec, i'll email you the paper  student: yes-yes. i tend to underestimate myself )) ok thank you    student: yeah, i guess. i always doubt my abilities. alright. thanks.",3,3
53875,168,"teacher: there goes, have a quick look please  student: ok opened it    student: fine. i've opened it.",2,1
53876,168,"teacher: part 1 is a summary task. i would start with part 2 just this one time because there's a method to the summary task that we won't have time to discuss today  student: understood so task 2 then    student: okay, i get it. let's just do task 2 then.",3,2
53877,168,"teacher: could you have a look at part 2? which option would you like?  student: hard to tell all of them are terrible    student: it's really difficult to say. honestly, all of them are just awful.",2,3
53878,168,teacher: i know!! :))))  student: 4 i guess    student: i think it's 4.,2,2
53879,168,"teacher: well, i suppose the question is, which one would be easiest to write about and work some good language in?  student: the only one i can relate to is number 4    student: i guess the only one i can somewhat connect with is number 4.",4,3

53986,54,"student: okey,i understand no.. the heathrow is an airport in london.  teacher: no! but heathrow is a specific place of course - so it depends on the place i'm afraid. so <student> your example there ('the heathrow....') is wrong... look at these: stansted is an airport just outside london./cambridge university is very famous./king's cross is a famous station in london. so...we do not use 'the' when we talk about 3 types of places (for example) : __________, __________ and ________??    teacher:oh, dear. it seems you have a slight misunderstanding. heathrow, you see, is an airport located in london. however, it's not just any airport. it's a specific place, you know? so, whether or not we use ""the"" depends on the place itself. unfortunately, your example of ""the heathrow is an airport in london"" is incorrect. let me give you some other examples to help clarify. we don't use ""the"" when talking about three types of places like airports, universities, and stations. for instance, stansted is an airport located just outside london. cambridge university is quite famous, you know. and let's not forget king's cross, a well-known station in london. so, the rule is, no ""the"" for these types of places. do you understand now?",4,3

54080,83,"student: ussualy we need to come at 8:00  teacher: goodness, that's early! and, with online school, you didn't have to ... (travel to school, what's the word from the last time?)    teacher: oh dear, how dreadfully early! and, in the realm of virtual education, you were not compelled to ... (commute to the educational institution, what was the term we discussed previously?)",4,3
54081,83,"student: commute  teacher: yes, correct! how were online classes vs. face-to-face classes?    teacher: indeed, i must agree. in terms of educational experiences, how did you find the comparison between online classes and face-to-face classes?",3,4
54082,83,student: face-to-face lessons were longer  teacher: oh really? interesting!    teacher: is that so? how fascinating!,4,3
54083,83,"student: we had pairs of face-to-face lessons  teacher: how do you mean? oh, i know double maths, double engish and so on right?    teacher: please share with the class the details of your recent educational experience. student: well, we were subjected to the monotonous routine of engaging in pairs for in-person lessons. teacher: i am intrigued. could you kindly elaborate further? student: ah, yes. it was a riveting affair of enduring back-to-back sessions of mathematics and english, among other subjects.",3,3
54084,83,"student: yes you're right  teacher: so, what do you hope will happen in september? would you like some elements of studying from home to remain in place?    teacher: well, let's discuss your aspirations for september. are you interested in the possibility of retaining certain aspects of remote learning?",4,2
54085,83,"student: we are going to have online school  teacher: oh, do you know for sure? or is it what you think will happen?    teacher: oh, so you're saying it's not just a possibility but a definite plan?",3,1
54086,83,"student: that's what news say  teacher: interesting! and for how long? i think here in the uk the government is trying to re-open schools in september, but it might not be possible    teacher: oh, how fascinating! and for what duration of time? it appears that in the united kingdom, the government is making efforts to potentially reopen schools in the month of september, although there may be obstacles preventing this from occurring.",3,1
54087,83,"student: there are still a lot of sick people  teacher: yes, true :(    teacher: indeed, unfortunately :(",1,0
54088,83,"student: i've already said about underground  teacher: yes, sure, people can't commute my son is starting school in september. it's going to be weird!    teacher: oh, absolutely, it's just a means of travel for people. by the way, my son will be commencing his education in september. it's quite an unusual experience!",2,1
54089,83,"student: do you know that now students in ukraine learn for 12 years ?  teacher: 12 years! do they start at 7?    teacher: oh, really? so, if i understand correctly, they must begin their education at the age of 7?",2,2
54090,83,"student: i'm lucky because i learn for 11 and first grade is something like kindergarden  teacher: oh, that's similar to the uk. the first grade is called 'reception', and it's a bit like kindergarten at what age do children start school then?    teacher: oh, how unexciting. in the uk, they refer to the first grade as 'reception', which is somewhat reminiscent of kindergarten i am curious, at what age do children commence their educational journey?",3,1
54091,83,"student: at 6  teacher: and why are you only going to be studying for 11 years?    teacher: oh, so you're only going to be studying for 11 years?",3,2
54092,83,"student: it's our old programme and all children who went to school 2 years ago study for 12 years  teacher: i see! it's a new rule then! very interesting    teacher: oh, i understand. so it's some kind of new regulation, huh? quite fascinating.",4,3
54093,83,"student: i went to school at 7  teacher: i see, me too! i think 7 is a good age to start school. because you get 7 years of freeeedom :)    teacher: ah, how riveting! i, too, experienced the joy of commencing my educational journey at that same mundane hour. it is widely believed that 7 is an acceptable age to begin one's schooling, as it grants us a staggering seven years of monotonous routine and limited autonomy.",3,2
54094,83,"student: not really  teacher: and, of course, because children are much more mature at 7 not really? kindergarten?    teacher: well, you see, the thing is, children at the age of 7 tend to display a higher level of maturity. so, naturally, it's not really surprising, is it? oh, and by the way, what about kindergarten?",2,2
54095,83,"student: yes  teacher: yes :( but maybe you liked your kindergarten? i know i didn't!    teacher: affirmative, unfortunately. however, perhaps you found some enjoyment in your early educational experiences? personally, i must confess, i did not.",3,3
54096,83,"student: but i didn't go there  teacher: ah, so you did get 7 years of freedom?    teacher: oh, so you're saying you didn't experience 7 whole years of freedom?",3,2
54097,83,"student: probably only 2 weeks  teacher: 2 weeks of freedom or 2 weeks of kindergarten? :)    teacher: so, just 2 weeks, huh? is it 2 weeks of freedom or 2 weeks of kindergarten? :)",3,2
54098,83,student: of kindergarden  teacher: sounds good!    teacher: that seems acceptable.,2,1
54099,83,"student: i went to pre-school  teacher: oh, it's the same thing, isn't it?    teacher: oh, it's essentially the identical experience, isn't it?",1,0
54100,83,student: no it doesn't  teacher: how is it different?    teacher: in what ways does it vary?,3,1
54101,83,"student: kindergarden is place where adults leave children when they work and pre-school is place where children learn how to write, read  teacher: ah, i understand, thanks for that    teacher: oh, i see. thank you for enlightening me with that information.",2,2
54102,83,"student: you're welcome  teacher: here in the uk, it's a pre-school or a nursery. i think the only difference is that pre-schools are state-owned and nurseries are private. quick grammar quiz, <student>    teacher: well, in the united kingdom, we have this thing called a pre-school or a nursery. it's not very exciting, really. the only thing that sets them apart is that pre-schools are owned by the state and nurseries are privately owned. now, let's move on to something even more thrilling - a quick grammar quiz, <student>.",3,3
54103,83,"student: ok  teacher: 1. if schools don't re-open in september, i ____ ____ could you finish the sentence, please?    teacher: 1. in the event that educational institutions fail to resume operations in september, i am curious to know what your thoughts are on the matter.",3,2
54104,83,"student: i'll stay at home  teacher: great! what about if i ____ in the usa now, i ____ eat cheeseburgers for breakfast! silly example, i know, just for the grammar    teacher: oh, splendid! have you ever contemplated the hypothetical scenario of my existence in the united states at this very moment? in such a situation, it is plausible that i might consume cheeseburgers as my morning sustenance. please bear in mind that this is merely an absurd illustration intended solely for the purpose of grammar elucidation.",3,3
54105,83,"student: have been/ will  teacher: how about 'if i were in the usa now, i would eat...'? does it sound familiar? it's ok if it doesn't!    teacher: how about considering the hypothetical scenario of 'if i were in the usa at this very moment, i would partake in the act of consuming...'? does it ring any bells? it's perfectly acceptable if it doesn't!",4,3
54106,83,"student: i think it's similar  teacher: it's a bit different, but we can look into this next time. it's called second conditionals, for things that are not true at the moment you've probably heard about it    teacher: it's marginally dissimilar, however, we can delve into this matter on a subsequent occasion. it's referred to as second conditionals, for situations that are presently untrue. you may have come across it in passing.",3,2
54107,83,"student: i thought that it's third conditional oh no  teacher: no worries, we'll play with this grammar next time!    teacher: don't fret, we'll have the pleasure of delving into this grammar in our next class.",3,3
54108,83,"student: can you remind please?  teacher: we are almost out of time now, i will next time, ok?    teacher: oh, well, it seems like we're running out of time here. i guess i'll have to remind you next time, if that's alright with you.",2,2
54109,83,"student: oh ok  teacher: don't worry about it, i just needed to see what could be new and interesting for you, ok? your english is very good! shall we do next wednesday at 9.30 am?    teacher: no need to fret, i simply required some insight into potential sources of novelty and fascination for you, alright? your english proficiency is quite commendable! how about we schedule for the following wednesday at 9.30 am?",4,3
54110,83,"student: yes! yes!  teacher: sure. it was lovely to talk to you, have a nice weekend! until wednesday!    teacher: certainly. it was somewhat pleasant engaging in conversation with you. i hope you have a satisfactory weekend. i shall see you again on wednesday.",4,2
54111,83,"student: why until wednesday?  teacher: because our next class is on wednesday! i didn't mean the weekend will last until wednesday    teacher: well, our next class just happens to fall on wednesday. so unfortunately, we have to endure the agonizing wait until then. just to clarify, i didn't imply that the weekend will miraculously stretch all the way until wednesday.",3,3
54112,83,"student: but i'm sure it'll be cool! i'm looking forward to our next lesson  teacher: me too :) bye for now!    teacher: yes, i feel a slight sense of anticipation as well. goodbye for now.",3,3
56364,258,student: hi olga!    student: hello olga.,1,0
56365,258,"teacher: hi giovanni! how are you?  student: good, thank you! how about you?    student: i'm fine. how are you?",3,1
56366,258,"teacher: all good, thank you! thanks for your essay, i really enjoyed reading it! some very nice language there :) i especially liked the inverted third conditional :) had it not been for this shared trove of knowledge and rules, it would have been impossible to build todays nations where millions of people, who are de facto strangers to each other, live and thrive together. i mean this one also, it's an elegant summary of the two viewpoints, very nice  student: thank you :) as i explained: it took me a while to write it, but i thought that sometimes trying to perfect one's language can be a good exercise :)    student: thanks. it took me some time to write it, but i think practicing language skills can be beneficial.",3,3
56367,258,"teacher: yes, absolutely. if you were in a situation where you have to observe the time limit such as an exam, i'd suggest sticking to a very clear structure with topic sentences, it does speed up the process! (i would say the structure is very clear in the last two paragraphs, but the beginning is more free-flowing)  student: maybe i should start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph ;) it took me a long time to write it for multiple reasons, among them the fact that i rewrote someparts... *some parts    student:i think i should write a topic sentence for each paragraph. it took me a while to write it because i had to rewrite some parts.",3,2
56368,258,"teacher: yes, a boring but reliable structure. 1. introduction (signposting early what you're going to write about) 2. topic sentence, expansion 3. topic sentence, expansion or maybe 4 too, i'm not saying there should be 3 paragraphs :)  student: yes, of course :) the problem is that it is difficult to be 'creative' with such a structure... since it is a topic that i'm interested in i had plenty to write about in 'my way'...but, of course, for an exam it's better to choose some topics and produce just what you're asked for :)    student: it's hard to be creative with this structure. i had a lot to write about in my own way because i'm interested in the topic. but for the exam, it's better to stick to the assigned topics and only write what you're asked to.",3,3
56369,258,"teacher: yes! but it's also difficult to steer away from the topic and get lost, which is a problem with a lot of exam writing (not yours, actually) yep, that's the trick! it is an interesting topic though, isn't it? and the one that's existed since the dawn of time as your video so nicely illustrates :)  student: yes, it is quite interesting, especially as a parent...and i think that it is becoming more and more apparent, as society changes with greater speeds...    student: yes, it's interesting, especially as a parent...and i think it's becoming more apparent as society changes quickly...",4,3
56370,258,"teacher: yes, i'm sure our kids' generation will find ways to shock us even though we might be thinking now that we've seen it all  student: if i think about the first time i surfed the internet, i was one of the first in my little town...and now, if we have a problem, that's 'too much' internet... haha, indeed...we'll have to wait and see what they come up with    student: i was an early internet user in my town. now, we'll see what solutions they propose for internet issues.",3,2
56371,258,"teacher: anyway, for our final lesson, have you maybe got any questions / anything you'd like to discuss / anything i can help with?  student: hmm...no, not really... as i told you i've bought the book you sent me via pdf, and i plan on working on it from start to finish    student:i have the book you sent me in pdf format. i will be working on it from beginning to end.",2,1
56372,258,"teacher: oh really? i must have missed it somehow! the orange one?  student: yes, from longman :)    student: yes, it's from longman.",2,2
56373,258,"teacher: i see, oh it's really good, i'm sure you'll enjoy it!  student: but then, if you have some exercises or interesting sayings with difficult vocabulary, that would be fine for me :) yes, i like how it is structured! and it is packed with exercises...    student: do you have any exercises or sayings with difficult vocabulary? i like the structure and the amount of exercises.",3,3
56374,258,"teacher: yes, i do have something prepared, we'll get to it in a second, just wanted to check with you first you probably do it anyway, but i do recommend reading good quality media in english, i do believe it helps with the language a lot! i know i've become a better writer because i do like my guardian articles :) what do you prefer to read in english?  student: i read mostly books...from biographies, to science and technology related treaties... sometimes i skim through bbc or cnn, but i find it hard to read with a attention a whole article on my mobile phone... oh, i also read a lot of scientific articles on machine learning, but the quality of the language there is mixed...    student: i read books, mostly biographies, science and technology treaties. sometimes i skim through articles on bbc or cnn, but it's difficult for me to read a whole article on my phone. i also read scientific articles on machine learning, but the language quality is mixed.",3,2
56375,258,"teacher: right, sure, the quality of the language is not the main point there i can imagine i think an opinion article is as close as it gets 'in real life' to those exam essays, and they're usually full of good language  student: it should be of some concern...but currently the pace at which articles in ml (machine learning) is out of control...which leads to lower quality in many aspects (including language) indeed...they also have the advantage of being 'short': i am used to long texts, but in real life you often need to be synthetic    student: i'm a bit worried about the increasing number of articles in machine learning. it's affecting the quality, especially in terms of language. also, shorter articles are more advantageous in real-life situations where being concise is important.",4,3
56376,258,"teacher: interesting! you're in a very dynamic field yes, absolutely, they are quite concise and pack a lot in a small space anyway, a little something i've prepared for you to practice those past conditionals (if you have the book handy, feel free to open this chapter, the one we were working on last time) i'm going to tell you a story and invite you to speculate about what could have happened if people had acted differently :)  student: i would dare to say that, to a point, it is a fad...a lot of people have been blinded by the promises of artificial intelligence, money is flowing and people are trying to apply it to everything...still it is very interesting and dynamic, indeed! okay! i have the book here, but i don't remember the page...    student: i think ai is just a trend. people are investing money in it and using it for everything. it's interesting and changes a lot. by the way, i have the book, but i forgot the page number.",4,3
56377,258,"teacher: one second, i'll find it a fad? very interesting, coming from you! as i said before, my main objection from the user side of it is 'artificial empathy'. it just doesn't work in my opinion! it's page 88 in the actual book and page 89 in the pdf ok, the story!  student: haha...not in all aspects, but in some, for instance empathy...or creating an artificial psychiatrist ;) yes, the story! are you still here?    student: are you still here?",3,2
56378,258,"teacher: it's about a poor musician called anton who lived in a small fishing village. he and the daughter of a rich fisherman, barbara, were in love, and he went to her father to ask for her hand. the father said that he had to have a boat to be able to marry his daughter and provide for her. but anton did not have a boat, only his guitar! anton went to his friend chris, a fisherman, and asked to borrow his boat. but chris refused him saying that he needed the boat for work. barbara and anton broked up. heartbroken, anton proposed to another girl, elizabeth, but elizabeth said he was still in love with barbara and turned him down. anton was unhappy and unmarried then. but who was to blame? sorry, still here, but a long story! in third conditional sentences, please :)  student: if anton had a boat he would have been able to support a family and barbara's father would have granted her hand.    student: if anton had a boat, he could have supported a family and barbara's father would have let her marry him.",4,3
56379,258,"teacher: *broke up, not broked! nearly! if anton ___ ___ a boat,  student: had had?    student: have i used ""had had"" correctly?",3,2
56380,258,teacher: yes! or barbara's father should have been more open-minded?  student: if christ hadn't needed the boat for work he would have borrowed it to anton.    student: christ couldn't lend the boat to anton because he needed it for work.,2,3
56381,258,"teacher: my guess is that in italian 'borrow' and 'lend' are the same verb :) he would have lent it to anton!  student: if barbara's father had grew up in another time he would have been more open-minded and let barbara choose who to marry.    student: if barbara's father grew up in a different time, he would have been more accepting and allowed barbara to choose her spouse.",3,4
56382,258,"teacher: nearly! had ___ up in another time  student: they are indeed, but to be fair i was a bit dubious about which verb to use... grown    student: yes, i was unsure about which verb to use...",3,2
56383,258,"teacher: lend (lent, lent) = let someone temporarily have something that belongs to you borrow: borrow some money from a bank, borrow a book from the library, may i borrow your pen, please? and which of them is a synonym of 'loan'?  student: i see :) the difference is between the fact that you are actively 'giving' something or 'taking' something... a loan is something you ask to the bank, so i'd go for 'borrow'... but i didn't know load is a verb too    student: i understand. the difference is whether you are giving or taking. a loan is something you ask the bank for, so i would choose 'borrow'. i didn't know 'load' is also a verb.",3,3
56384,258,"teacher: yes! like in italian, it's the same verb in my native language, so i could recognize the problem :) but there's a very clear distinction in english. also, you don't use 'have' instead of 'borrow' there's a big difference between 'you can have it' and 'you can borrow it'! if you say 'you can have it', you don't expect 'it' back!  student: that's quite clear to me    student: i understand",3,1
56385,258,"teacher: ok, sure! to take out a loan / apply for a bank loan means to borrow money from a bank or to try to do so  student: haha i know :) unless you say something like 'you can have it for a couple of days, but i need it this sunday'    student: yeah, i understand. unless you specifically mention that i can borrow it temporarily, but you need it back by sunday.",3,2
56386,258,teacher: but 'to loan' means 'to lend'  student: (i hope i'm not making up an expression) oh...okay    student: okay.,2,1
56387,258,"teacher: banks loan money yes, exactly, it would be clearer to say 'you can borrow it for a couple of days!'  student: so my reasoning was wrong...ok...i guess it is more formal i mean loan is used in more formal situations, right?    student: i was incorrect in my reasoning. it seems that using ""loan"" is more appropriate in formal situations. is that correct?",3,3
56388,258,"teacher: ooh, we're out of time!  student: or maybe with money/institutions?    student: can we consider the influence of money and institutions?",2,2
56389,258,"teacher: yes, absolutely!  student: 13:59 on my laptop    student: i am using my laptop at 13:59.",2,1
56390,258,"teacher: loan is more formal! right, thank you very much for participating in this project! it's been a pleasure to chat with you over the last few months :) you've still got my email address if you'd like to contact me one day, i'll be very happy to hear from you!  student: thank you! it was a pleasure for me too! and also a great opportunity for me, and science :) of couse! you have my e-mail too, for instnace if you ever need some suggestions about what to visit in italy ;) thank you again! and have a great summer! bye, bye!    student: thank you. it was nice. i enjoyed it and learned something. you have my email if you need help with italy. thank you again. have a good summer. goodbye.",4,3
56392,253,"student: hi <teacher>!    student: hello, teacher.",2,0
56393,253,teacher: hi <student>! how are you? how was your trip?  student: hi! i am good thank you :) it was great! a bit tiring though: we met with a lot of relatives... how about you? how are you?    student: hello. i am fine. it was good. a little tiring because we saw many relatives. how are you?,3,3
56394,253,"teacher: sounds lovely! well, i had my first dose a week ago, so yay! of the covid vaccine i mean  student: of course...austria just sent the appointments to everyone who asked for the vaccine: i am getting my first dose in a month :)    student: austria sent vaccine appointments to those who requested them. i will receive my first dose in a month.",4,3
56395,253,"teacher: otherwise, we keep waiting for some sun, maybe we'll finally glimpse it this weekend yay! a wait, but at least you have a date i suppose  student: that's true! the weather was terrible in italy too...we had only two days without rain    student: yes, it's true. the weather was bad in italy as well. we only had two rain-free days.",2,3
56396,253,"teacher: really? well, if even italy is all rainy, it kind of makes me feel a bit better :)  student: haha...in italy we have a saying 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy)    student: in italy, there's a saying that goes 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy).",3,4
56397,253,"teacher: haha, exactly! :) i wonder what the saying is in english, there should be something...  student: but i didn't have time for the writing, sorry...we really travelled a lot! miserly loves company...maybe (i found it with google, i didn't know it)    student: i didn't have time to do the writing. sorry, i was busy traveling. i found the answer on google. i didn't know it before.",3,2
56398,253,"teacher: no worries! i'm taking the next week off teaching because my son will be on holiday, so if you still want to do it, you'll have some extra time  student: that's great! agreed!    student: okay. sure.",3,1
56399,253,"teacher: yes, kind of 'misery loves company', hmmm but the italian one is more joyful!  student: yes, at least it mentions something that isn't misery..    student: yeah, it talks about something other than sadness..",3,2
56400,253,"teacher: lovely! also, i am sad to say that we will be closing the teaching project on june 18, which means that we will only have the time for two classes, between june 7 and june 18  student: i see :) okay, well it was a nice opportunity so i can only be thankful abou it and i am curious to see what sort of reserach they do on the papers: i'll follow the professor who i first contacted for this opportunity ;)    student: i understand. it was a good chance, so i'm grateful. i'm interested in the research they do on the papers. i'll follow the professor i initially reached out to for this opportunity.",3,3
56401,253,"teacher: yes, it's been a pleasure on my part, and of course, we are very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself  student: it's been a pleasure for me too!    student: same here.",3,2
56402,253,"teacher: i think they're taking the research in more than one direction at the moment. yes, i'm sure you can contact <researcher> for more information if you're curious, he did mention it  student: cool, thank you :) it would be cool if i eventually end up working also on the data i contributed to generate...    student: thanks. it would be nice if i could work on the data i helped create eventually...",4,3
56403,253,"teacher: ok, so the question is, what would you like to focus on in our remaining time? i've been planning to look at some more speaking questions from c2 proficiency today  student: (if they release it openly) okay, let's look at speaking questions!    student: let's study speaking questions.",3,2
56404,253,"teacher: yes, <researcher> would be a better person to speak to about this than myself! it would be cool if i eventually end up working also on the data i contributed to generate i feel that 'also' is a bit out of place here. what would be a better place for it?  student: oh, the also is in the wrong position there, right? yep    student: the ""also"" is misplaced, correct? yes",3,2
56405,253,"teacher: haha, yes! you see it yourself, don't you?  student: i could either remove it, or...maybe...i could put it before 'working': end up also working ...    student: i can either remove it or maybe put it before 'working': end up also working ...",3,3
56406,253,"teacher: yes! i like it before 'working'.  student: yes and no...but now, everytime i write it an alarm bel rings in my head so i try to pay more attention (not in that case, apparently)    student: i sometimes pay attention when writing, but not always. lately, i've been trying to be more focused because i keep hearing an alarm bell in my head. however, it didn't work in this particular case.",3,3
56407,253,"teacher: also working' - like other researchers it's german interference, isn't it? i can just hear 'arbeiten auch' in my mind  student: yes...moreover german has an interjection which is written 'also', has a slightly different sound... the way we use 'anche' in italian, which is the closes word to 'also' we have, is also different...    student: german has an interjection written 'also' with a slightly different sound. in italian, we use 'anche' as the closest word to 'also', but it is also different.",3,4
56408,253,"teacher: aah, yes, i remember! indeed  student: so it is really tricky for me ;)    student: i find it difficult.",2,1
56409,253,"teacher: i can imagine!  student: *the closest anyway, practise makes perfect :) as you see if i think about it i am starting to correct it!    student: i am trying to practice and improve my work.",3,2
56410,253,"teacher: ok, c2 questions! i think i mentioned last time that there are several parts to the speaking test, and in the first part the questions are focused on you rather than abstract i'm warning you, some of them are a bit weird, you'll have to just roll with them and show off your english!  student: okay, that's fine!    student: alright, i agree.",3,3
56411,253,"teacher: you'll see what i mean (i'll start with not so weird ones though) the test always begins with, please tell us your name, are you a student or do you work and then maybe 'where are you from', no need to answer those now next question: you said you are from friulli (did i get that right??) is that an interesting place to live?  student: those are the easy ones.. yes, i am originally from friuli (just one 'l').    student: the questions are simple. yes, i am from friuli.",3,2
56412,253,"teacher: yep, they give the examiner a chance to fill in the papers :) sorry! friuli  student: it depends on what you mean by 'interesting'. it is a small, rural region which was among the poorest in italy before the so called italian economic miracle of the sixties...    student: it's a small, rural region that used to be poor before the italian economic miracle of the sixties.",3,3
56413,253,"teacher: ok, lovely! feel free to add another sentence or two  student: i find it interesting because you can experience nature in all its forms: from mountains, to the sea side...and, as any place in italy, it has many places that are interesting as far as history is concerned. for instance trieste, with castle miramare, or palmanova: a small city which still has the original footprint from the middle ages and looks like a star, surrounded by its wals, when you look at it from a map. in this sense it is quite interesting :) but i would use the word quiet to describe it: if you look for a thrilling night life you should look somewhere else.    student: italy has various natural and historical attractions, such as mountains, the seaside, trieste with its castle miramare, and palmanova, a small medieval city shaped like a star. it is interesting in terms of history. however, it is not known for its exciting nightlife.",4,4
56414,253,"teacher: ok, thanks! great sophisticated grammar, i like it! it would be helpful to use some synonyms to 'interesting' though, such as...  student: (maybe when you see an aerial view would be a better way to say 'look from a map')    student: (perhaps an aerial view is a more suitable phrase to describe observing from a map)",3,2
56415,253,"teacher: what comes to your mind? yes, sure, because you mean 'look at its map', but an aerial view is a better expression!  student: oh..i didn't think about synonyms...this is a trick i should remember... to be honest i don't have many synonyms...maybe stimulating, in certain contexts? noteworthy    student: i didn't consider synonyms. it's a trick i should remember. honestly, i don't have many synonyms. maybe stimulating, in certain contexts? noteworthy.",4,3
56416,253,"teacher: yes, you would probably use 'interesting' in real life, and so would a native speaker, but you aren't scoring any points with it in the test as you can imagine!  student: okay! but i should probably exercise with synonyms because it isn't that easy (even when looking at italian synonyms for help ;) )    student: i will exercise with synonyms because it's not easy, even when using italian synonyms for assistance.",3,2
56417,253,"teacher: i find it interesting... could be replaced with something like 'it appeals to me' noteworthy is a good one! and then all kind of descriptive adjectives, like 'fascinating' etc. there is a lot unpack / explore in terms of history etc.  student: indeed...i should exercise by paraphrasing questions    student: i should practice paraphrasing questions by exercising.",4,3
56418,253,"teacher: ok, let's try another one!  student: into ones that use more refined terms.    student: i'm tired of studying. i don't want to do it anymore.",2,2
56419,253,"teacher: exactly, with that in mind how good are you at organising your time?  student: scheduling my day is a fundamental task for me: i have a busy life, with two small children, and i can't expect things to work out without any planning.    student: i need to schedule my day because i have a busy life with two small children. planning is important.",3,3
56420,253,"teacher: excellent! great paraphrasing  student: therefore i'd answer saying i am good at planning my day, even when this means handling unexpected events. which are common among parents of small children.    student: i think i am good at planning my day, even when unexpected events happen, which is common for parents of small children.",4,3
56421,253,"teacher: lovely! a good expression: firefighting (especially in the work context) dealing with problems that pop up unexpectedly too much time is spent firefighting rather than moving the business forward. an example from the dictionary  student: oh, that's a lovely expression! and i am not sure i've ever encountered it...i'll write it down :)    student: that expression is nice. i haven't seen it before. i will write it down.",4,2
56422,253,"teacher: yes, very useful! my husband says it all the time, when he's annoyed that he hasn't made any progress because he's been firefighting the minor crises ok, the next one! what would you dream job be? (they are eliciting conditionals and the grammar of speculations like could / might here!)  student: if i had the possibility to go back in time, i would try to focus my efforts into becoming a pilot with the final objective of becoming an astronaut. i might have actually attempted to follow this passion of mine if it was not for my parents who are scared of flying... and made it very clear that, if i was to flight, they would be in a constant state of alert and fear. (okay, i exaggerated a bit, but it was just to show off some language)    student: i wanted to be a pilot and astronaut, but my parents are afraid of flying and wouldn't let me pursue it.",3,3
56423,253,"teacher: excellent! just one objection. third conditional: i might have attempted, it it ___ ___ ___ for my parents (because it's in past) *in the past  student: if it were not for my parents?    student: what if my parents weren't involved?",3,2
56424,253,"teacher: if it had not been! the pure third conditional is 'past perfect, if would / might / could have v3'  student: okay..i guess i'll have to check it again..    student: fine, i will review it once more.",3,1
56425,253,"teacher: i'll make a note, if we've got some time left, we can do a bit of third conditional practice in june but otherwise great! ok, are you ready for the weird one? how important is the internet for you?  student: i must say i was expecting a weirder question...    student: the question wasn't as strange as i anticipated.",3,3
56426,253,"teacher: really? i've got to up my game :) i thought this was weird!  student: the internet is fundamental for me: sometimes i am scared when thinking about how much of my activities rely on it: from working, to listening to music and shopping...    student: the internet is important to me. i rely on it for work, music, and shopping. sometimes it scares me to think about how much i depend on it.",3,4
56427,253,"teacher: the best answer to this would be, 'excuse me, inte... what?' sorry, go on!  student: i can hardly move a stone without connecting to some server to check how many steps i've taken today or using a neural network to try an identify the species of the insect that is strolling through my porch... haha...agreed! i'll write down that answer... maybe 20 years ago...    student: i use technology a lot to track my steps and identify insects. it's funny how things have changed in the past 20 years.",3,4
56428,253,"teacher: no, don't write it down! :))  student: nowadays even driving a car often relies on an internet connection, if not for the driving itself, at least for the directions    student: cars now need internet for driving and directions.",3,3
56429,253,"teacher: love the vocabulary! brilliant! and you managed to avoid using the word 'important'))  student: i was joking ;) thank you! i must say that i should exercise a bit, as currently my words are stirred more by the will to produce outstanding english rather than saying what i mean to say haha but, as you said, the examiners don't know anything about me, they are there only to evaluate my english    student: thanks for the reminder. i need to focus on being clear in my english instead of trying to impress. the examiners are only there to assess my english skills.",3,4
56430,253,"teacher: exactly! i wouldn't worry about truthfulness here!  student: good :) i guess i have to go now, right? what time in 2 weeks? i should be available again on tuesday    student: i need to know the time for the next session in 2 weeks. i will be available on tuesday.",3,1

56960,211,"teacher: well, schools are re-opening next monday, which is some normality i suppose. and i'll be able to see other people at pick-up and drop-off! we bought a new car a few weeks ago, but we aren't allowed to go anywhere until march 29 which is going to be the second phase of unlocking  student: well, school is a start..to think that now we are counting on the opportunity to see other parents when bringing children to school...    student: school is a place where we can see other parents when dropping off our children.",3,2
56961,211,"teacher: i know, goodness! just to see other human beings!  student: i see...here things are more relaxed now, but you need to do a quick test for almost everything...for istance, if i want to go to the office, i have to test every second day.    student: i have to do frequent tests, even for simple tasks like going to the office.",3,3
56962,211,"teacher: i'm very lucky to be locked down with a family, of course. i can't imagine what it's like for single people!  student: i agree on that one..sometimes i wish for some silence but, to be honest, i believe people living alonge have it much harder...    student: i agree. sometimes i want silence. but honestly, i think people who live alone have it harder.",3,2
56963,211,"teacher: hmm, interesting! the country must be well stocked up on instant tests have you been going to the office? yes, you seem way ahead in terms of being out of lockdown! they haven't even offered a timeframe on the return to offices here  student: yes, they are aiming at doing 3 million per week or so, in a country with something like 8.5 million inhabitants.    student: they plan to produce around 3 million per week in a country with roughly 8.5 million people.",3,2
56964,211,"teacher: is that all? i thought austria had a bigger population! there are about 66 million in the uk  student: so far i didn't go: it has opened starting today, but i couldn't get the test done...my wife had the astrazeneca vaccine and suffered from a bad fever as a side effect... so the last three days were intense ;)    student: i couldn't go to the session today because i didn't finish the test. my wife got the astrazeneca vaccine and had a fever as a side effect, so the past three days were busy.",3,3
56965,211,"teacher: oh i see, sorry to hear that!! hope she'll feel better very soon!  student: today she is better, in fact she is currently out with the children...some silence, finally ;) yes, austria is small..especially when you think that wien and its surroundings count 2.5 million inhabitants...    student: she is feeling better today. she is currently with the children. austria is small, especially when you consider that vienna and its surroundings have 2.5 million inhabitants.",3,4
56966,211,"teacher: interesting! english people spell it 'vienna'  student: you are right, also italian people do...and also austrian actually... i don't know why i went for the german spelling...    student: yes, italians and austrians also do the same thing. i'm not sure why i used the german spelling.",2,3
56967,211,"teacher: anyway, the vaccine is a milestone even if it comes at a cost, congratulations to your wife!  student: thanks :)    student: thank you.",3,2
56968,211,"teacher: the austrians spell it differently from the germans? i didn't know that either  student: one thing that i can't really understand is that in italy they consider university staff as high priority, so a lot of my ex-collegues have been vaccinated...even though they are working remotely most of the time and barely see anyone the official german is wien, i believe...but austrian tend to have also 'their' version of some words... and i have heard them say vienna..    student: in italy, university staff is considered high priority for vaccination. many of my ex-colleagues have been vaccinated, even though they work remotely and have limited interactions. the official german word for vienna is wien, but austrians also have their own version of some words. i have heard them say vienna.",3,2
56969,211,"teacher: ah, they've adopted the occupation-based approach then. it's strictly age-based in the uk, the only exception being people with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable  student: yes, but currently they are vaccinating people over 80, medical stuff...and then, before school teachers (who see their pupils at school) they went for university staff...    student: yes, currently they are vaccinating people over 80 and medical staff. after that, they will vaccinate school teachers and then university staff.",3,1
56970,211,"teacher: i've been thinking about you saying 'silence', as in a break from the kids. i would use 'quiet' instead. or 'peace and quiet'  student: i don't really understand the ratio...but then, there is little i can do, i only hope that things will speed up :) oh, okay...i guess silence is more of a literary word?    student: i don't understand the ratio. i can't do much about it. i hope things will go faster. oh, okay. silence is more of a literary word, i guess.",3,2
56971,211,"teacher: oh, now that i'm thinking about it, they vaccinated medical professionals in the first group as well. but school teachers, police etc. don't get a priority, a decision that meets with a lot of criticism silence and quiet (as a noun) are very close, but silence is about the act of not uttering a sound while quiet is about the enjoyable perception of the lack of loud noises if it makes any sense  student: it does..i had never appreciated the difference, thank you for the description! so it would be 'i remained silent/in silence' vs 'the house is quiet'    student: thank you for explaining the difference between ""i remained silent/in silence"" and ""the house is quiet."" i had never appreciated it before.",4,3
56972,211,"teacher: i just feel it would be more 'english' to say, ah, some peace and quiet at last! (kids are in bed or something like that) yes, exactly! your examples are spot-on  student: that was just a simple example...but thank you!    student: that was an example. thank you.",3,1
56973,211,"teacher: great, shall we go to the last exercise in the use of english part of the test? and then i've prepared a bit of linguistic deliciousness for you :)  student: yes! let me find the file    student: okay, i will locate the file.",3,2
56974,211,"teacher: please, it's page 6 in the pdf  student: part 4, found it!    student: i found part 4.",2,1
56975,211,"teacher: lovely! key word tranformation, probably the trickiest 'use of english' task. which is reflected in the fact that each sentence gets two points, not one, like in the previous tasks i mean when it's being marked  student: i see...let's try 25. no telling 25. no telling how long    student: i understand. let's attempt 25. uncertain 25. uncertain duration",3,3
56976,211,"teacher: you can use 3-8 words for the gap, and the challenge is to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible  student: nope...i have to think a bit longer for these indeed... 25. no telling how long it    student: i need more time to think about these questions. question 25 is particularly difficult to determine the duration.",3,2
56977,211,"teacher: yes, correct! the last option  student: 26. is little demand for    student: there is not much demand for 26.",2,1
56978,211,"teacher: yes, good!  student: 27. impressed by how good great a (i am not 100% sure about the preprositions 'by' here) 28. resignation came as a surprise to (29 later) 30. the height of his power    student: 27. i am impressed by how good i am (not sure about the preposition 'by' here) 28. resignation came as a surprise to me (29 later) 30. he was at the height of his power",3,2
56979,211,"teacher: hold on, 27. the preposition is good! also with / at are possible. but 'good' doesn't quite convey the meaning, the answer is 'skilled' or 'skillful'  student: interesting...actually i work also on paraphrase problem    student: i am also working on the paraphrase problem.",3,3
56980,211,"teacher: 28 = correct  student: and changing 'skill' with 'good' is the sort of mistake i expect from my models...i should have read the sentence twice! thank you for pointing it out 29. was not a tree whatsoever in i am really not sure about 29, i am wondering if i should keep the word 'vegetation'    student: i made a mistake by replacing 'skill' with 'good' in my sentence. i should have read it again. thank you for pointing it out. in sentence 29, there was no tree at all. i am unsure if i should keep the word 'vegetation' in sentence 29.",3,4
56981,211,"teacher: yes, this task is different from others, in that paraphrasing is actually discouraged exactly, good idea! there was no vegetation whatsoever in/ there was nothing whatsoever growing in because there could have been a bush / flower, not necessarily a tree and the same issue in 30. how would you change your answer to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible?  student: i see...i was thinking that 'a tree whatsoever' would convey the meaning of 'a tree or anything similar'...but maybe my understanding of the word whatsoever isn't correct. at the height of his success, where i am not sure how you spell 'success'...anyway    student: i think 'a tree whatsoever' means 'a tree or something similar' but i might be wrong. also, i'm not sure how to spell 'success'.",3,3
56982,211,"teacher: oh no, whatsoever just means 'absolutely none', it's a way of amplifying 'no'. he has no money/ friends whatsoever. yes, at the height of his success!  student: okay :) it was difficult indeed...and, at least from this first attempt, i'd say keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem. is the most difficult part of the problem.    student: it was difficult. keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem. it's the most difficult part.",3,2
56983,211,"teacher: oh, exactly, and you got all the expressions they are looking for right, i think it's about learning the logic of the task in writing and speaking, the situation is reverse. you are expected to paraphrase, especially at this level of proficiency for example, if the examiner asks you, 'do you prefer to spend time on your own or with friends?' in a speaking test,  student: which means i should definitely prepare for the exam, it shouldn't be too difficult.    student: i should prepare for the exam because it's not too difficult.",3,1
56984,211,"teacher: it would be a bit of a waste of opportunity to start saying, 'i prefer to spend my time with friends...' because you've just repeated the question and haven't shown off your english when you could have said, 'i'm quite gregarious, and i'm most in my element among people'  student: i see...    student: i understand...",3,0
56985,211,"teacher: but in key word transformation, only the necessary paraphrasing!  student: okay! it is so difficult for me to talk about my free time i mean, in the current situation...    student: it's hard for me to talk about my free time right now.",2,1
56986,211,"teacher: haha, yes, i can imagine! it's just an example  student: i enjoy both company and solitude, even though i would normally tend towards the latter. i enjoy studying and learning. but now i have children and i am under a light lockdown, so i am always with my children...    student: i like being alone sometimes, but i also like being around people. i enjoy studying and learning. but now i have kids and i can't go out much, so i'm always with them...",2,2
56987,211,"teacher: but again, the skill for the speaking task is to talk at length in a way that shows off your language on any topic. the good news is, you don't ever have to be truthful, just whatever gives your english a chance to shine! for example, i wouldn't really describe myself as gregarious, but it was the first c2 word that came to my mind, and i went with it  student: haha, i know...this reminds me of hugh laurie, when he auditioned for dr house he lied about where he was staying, because he felt like 'chicago' was too difficult to say with an american accent (i believe it was chicago) i see...well, if latin words are a plus, it shouldn't be difficult for me...    student: i know. it reminds me of hugh laurie. when he auditioned for dr house, he lied about where he was staying because he thought saying 'chicago' with an american accent was hard. i think it was chicago. i understand. if latin words are a good thing, it shouldn't be hard for me.",3,3
56988,211,"teacher: oh really? love it! (and love hugh laurie, one of my favourite actors)  student: yes...it was one of his interviews, but finding it now would be like looking for the needle in a haystack    student: i believe it was one of his interviews, but it would be difficult to find it now.",3,2
56989,211,"teacher: ah, speaking of words! the promised linguistic treat have you ever heard of tom swift books / jokes? yes, a needle in a haystack, true!  student: no i haven't heard of him...    student: i am not familiar with him.",3,1
56990,211,"teacher: i've never read the books, but they are apparently sci-fi for teenagers or something like that but! they gave birth to a whole series of jokes that mimick the style of the book the jokes are based on puns (do you know this one?)  student: no, i don't know it sorry...    student: sorry, i don't know it.",3,1
56991,211,"teacher: a play on the fact that a particular word has more than one meaning i'll give you an example what's black and white and red (= read) all over? - a newspaper  student: oh, now i see! sorry...    student: i understand now. i apologize.",3,2
56992,211,"teacher: this is a pun based on the fact that 'red' and 'read' have the same pronunciation  student: i though you were asking about thi series of jokes, i assumed this was also published as a book or something... okay, i actually knew that a 'pun' was some sort of joke, but i didn't know it involved word's meaning in particular.    student: i was confused about the jokes you mentioned. i thought they might be in a book. i knew that a 'pun' was a type of joke, but i didn't know it involved the meaning of words.",4,3
56993,211,"teacher: oh sorry, i confused you! no, i was just trying to say that 'tom said' jokes are based on some wordplay ok, let's have a look at a couple of jokes, i wonder if you know both meaning of words...  student: okay!    student: alright.",4,1
56994,211,"teacher: 'i'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' tom said cryptically. here, the play is on the fact that a crypt is a burial place, like a mausoleum, but cryptically means 'with an air of mystery' does it make sense?  student: haha...okay, cryptically refers both to in a manner of speaking, as if hiding something, and refers to crypts? the old cemetery yes    student: yes, cryptically refers to speaking indirectly or hiding something, and it also refers to crypts, which are found in old cemeteries.",4,3
56995,211,"teacher: yes!! i needn't have explained it to you :) another one 'pass me the shellfish,' said tom crabbily.  student: hmm...this time you need to explain me...or better, i am pretty sure that crabbiliy refers also to crabs but i don't know the other meaning of the word    student: can you explain the meaning of ""crabbily""? i think it might have something to do with crabs, but i'm not sure about its other definition.",4,2
56996,211,"teacher: well, yes, it comes from 'crab', but it means grumpy and bad-tempered!  student: i see    student: i understand",3,1
56997,211,"teacher: good non-latin word)) the boss is well crabby today or something like that  student: haha...okay, i will remember this one!    student: i understand. i will remember this.",2,2
56998,211,"teacher: ok, one last! aaand the chatroom decided to crash!  student: i see indeed that's the case    student: i understand yes, that is true",2,1
56999,211,"teacher: ah, i'll have to let you go. would you like to do the reading tasks in the same pdf? if you have the time i mean as homework  student: okay, i will try to do them! yes, now i have a call    student: i will attempt to complete the tasks. i have a phone call now.",3,2

57011,88,"student: yeah, i understand  teacher: some people live in flats, especially in big cities, and flats are usually on one level. which is probably why they are called 'flats', now that i'm thinking about it    teacher: some people live in flats, especially in big cities, and flats are usually on one level. they are called 'flats'.",3,2

57066,37,"teacher: ok great - so if you can face it, let's go back to the pie charts ok? can you give me a sentence about coal in france in 1980 please? just that nothing else ok?  student: ok coal accounted for 25% of electricity in france in 1980 coal made up for 25% of electricity in france in 1980.    student: the student wrote a message saying that coal accounted for 25% of electricity in france in 1980.",3,2
57067,37,"teacher: yes thanks <student> that's great language well done ....be careful with the proportion though! check the units ok? is it really 25%?  student: wow, it is not 100 units... sorry, my internet became slowly just now    student: it's not 100 units. sorry, my internet is slow now.",3,1
57068,37,"teacher: no that's ok....so no, it's not 100 units... how can you say it then?  student: so...approximately 27% of electricity form/by coal.    student: approximately 27% of electricity comes from coal.",3,2
57069,37,"teacher: ok thanks... wow, you could try and work it out like that if you like....maybe an easier way would be to say e.g. 25 out of 90 units or more than a quarter ...ok?  student: ok    student: i understand.",3,1
57070,37,teacher: so in fact <student> fractions (half/third/quarter etc) are good to use for variety in language ok? so for example ...52% = just _____ half?  student: just more than half just exceeding half    student: okay,3,2
57071,37,teacher: can you try it with just one word in the gap? beginning with 'o'!  student: just over half    student: 50.01%,3,3
57072,37,"teacher: yes thanks! i think that's best.. it is best!  student: ok,thanks    student: thank you.",2,1
57073,37,teacher: and what about e.g. 23%?  student: just over third. just over fifth    student: a little more than one-third. a little more than one-fifth.,3,2
57074,37,teacher: yes! or just ________ a quarter?  student: just less a quarter    student: 0.25,1,1
57075,37,teacher: so if you say 'less' you need to say 'less than' ....so just use one word ok? beginning with 'u'!  student: just u.... a quarter    student: i only have a quarter.,2,2
57076,37,teacher: opposite of 'over'  student: i am not sure that word..    student: i don't understand that word.,1,1
57077,37,teacher: under! just under a quarter  student: haha...thanks    student: thank you.,3,2
57078,37,teacher: ok!  student: just under a quarter    student: 0.25,2,1
57079,37,"teacher: yes that's it good...so by the way you need 'a' before all fractions except for 'half' (although it's possible to out it in for 'half' too) so e.g. a third/a quarter  student: ok, i got it    student: i understand.",3,2
57080,37,"teacher: when it's just one i mean...actually 'one' is correct too right? so a/one third etc but e.g. two fifths/three quarters etc ...obviously without 'a' so <student>...last individual one...what about coal in australia in 2000?! tell me about that in one sentence (try a fraction if you like too)  student: ok, it is a very different way to explain date    student: the way you explained the concept of date is quite unique.",3,3
57081,37,teacher: do you mean fractions?  student: cola was 130 out of 170 units in australia in 2000    student: cola was 130 out of 170 units in australia in 2000.,2,1
57082,37,teacher: ok fine...hol don hold on i mean!  student: ok    student: okay.,1,0
57083,37,"teacher: so yes fine - good to get that little structure 'out of' correct ! or ... e.g. coal accounted for 130 out of 170 units of electricity or e.g. coal generated 130 out of 170 units  student: ok, i understand,,thanks    student: i comprehend. thank you.",3,2
57084,37,teacher: and the passive structure? remember that possibility? so e.g. 130 out of 170 units of electricity...(can you finish this one?)  student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity form/by coal.    student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity come from coal.,3,3
57085,37,teacher: yes ok but you need a verb somewhere!  student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity was produced from/by coal    student: 130 out of 170 units of electricity were produced by coal.,3,2
57086,37,"teacher: yes ok good thanks! because it's units it is plural so we need 'were produced from' (good to use verb 'produced' by the way)  student: ok,i got it,thanks    student: i understand. thank you.",3,1
57087,37,"teacher: ok <student> so let's take another step here ok? so we have given the basic numbers for coal in 2000 (130 out of 170 units) ...but what does really mean? it's good if we can say that in words you know? what i mean is ...in bad english we might say: 'yes coal really big 2000' do you see? but in good ielts english we could say...? not the numbers just this idea in words  student: coal was by far the most popular fuel, with 130 out of 170 units were produced.    student: 130 out of 170 units were produced using coal, which was the most popular fuel.",3,3
57088,37,teacher: thanks <student> - a very good sentence overall...hold on  student: ok    student: i understand.,3,1
57089,37,"teacher: so if we make 2 basic correct sentences we could get: coal was by far the most significant (better than 'popular' here because people aren't actually choosing it like coca cola you see?) fuel. it produced 130 out of 170 units. ok?  student: ok, it is better than my sentence.    student: it's better than what i wrote.",3,2
57090,37,"teacher: well yes i guess so! but we can take one more step if we like....look at the one coming up...can you see i have deleted the full stop and the verb - you just need to change the form of the verb ..can you try it?coal was by far the most significant fuel, _________ 130 out of 170 units so e.g. 'produce/produced/producing'? you decide!  student: ok, less verbs make sentences more academic. produced because it was in 2000.    student: using fewer verbs in sentences makes them more academic. it was produced in 2000.",3,3
57091,37,"teacher: ok right so i know what you mean but remember 'prodcued was in the original two sentence version but here we are changing it so we need: ...coal was by far the most significant fuel, producing130 out of 170 units have you seen that before?  student: no.. i just could write very simple sentences before.    student: i used to only be able to write basic sentences.",3,2
57092,37,teacher: ok well don't worry too much - the first two-sentence version was still good and you could still get a high score with that ok?  student: ok hanks thanks    student: thank you.,3,1
57093,37,"teacher: ok <student> before we finish this hour let me ask you one final question....can you tell me about nuclear power in france in 1980 and 2000. so you could try it like this: 'in 1980, nuclear power.....however, in 2000....' ok?!  student: ok.. in 1980, nuclear power accounted for 15 out of 90 units of electricity,however, in 2000, it was by far the most signifiant fuel, producing 126 out of 180 units. i think my type speed have become more quickly than a few days ago. have becoming    student: in 1980, nuclear power made up 15 out of 90 units of electricity. however, in 2000, it was the most significant fuel, producing 126 out of 180 units. i think my typing speed has improved compared to a few days ago. i have been improving.",4,3
57094,37,"teacher: ooohh <student>! that's a great sentence! i'm very happy with that! perfect...a great ending...i'll see you in 15 minutes ok?  student: ok, see you later    student: bye, see you later",4,1
57095,37,teacher: ok  student: thanks    student: thank you,1,0
58899,77,teacher: hi there <student>...    teacher: hello <student>...,1,0
58900,77,"student: hi <teacher>  teacher: i fear my internet might be a bit dodgy today but we'll hope for the best!    teacher: my internet might not be very reliable today, but let's hope it works fine.",4,1
58901,77,"student: sorry, i'm late! i took me a few minutes to get here... my laptop is being very slow toda  teacher: ah that's ok....i'm having a few little problems too!    teacher: it's okay. i'm also facing some issues.",3,2
58902,77,"student: ah ok, no problem  teacher: hey <student>...i think i might have mentioned to you the value of comments on internet forums etc for language learning?    teacher: hello <student>...i believe i may have previously discussed the importance of comments on internet forums and similar platforms for language learning.",3,3
58903,77,student: not sure about it... tell me a bit more please  teacher: ok...well i've been looking at some for french and i've just been reminded o f what a rich source they are ...    teacher: i have been looking at some resources for french and i have been reminded of their richness.,2,2
58904,77,"student: do you recommend that forums to learn english? those, sorry  teacher: well i think taht for a more advanced learner they are, as i say, a really rich source of spoken-style language they contain a huge amount of authentic idiomatic language for esample and i;ve been looking at some in english to think about english teaching and it's confirmed this idea    teacher: i believe that for advanced learners, they are a valuable source of spoken-style language. they contain a lot of authentic idiomatic language. i have been studying some in english to consider using them for english teaching, and it has confirmed my idea.",3,3
58905,77,student: it sounds very good i don't think we've talked about it before... could you mention the ones you know?  teacher: but it's great because for example you get one youtube video and hundreds of comments and they all naturally use a whole range of language to describe the same thing you know? it's like a mini-corpus! yes nothing special - i just mean on e.g. youtube videos or newspaper websites (where they have comment sections after opinion pieces for example)    teacher: people use different words to describe the same thing in the comments of a youtube video. it's like a small collection of language. it's not anything extraordinary. i'm referring to places like youtube videos or newspaper websites that have comment sections after opinion pieces.,3,3
58906,77,"student: ahh now i see what you mean  teacher: i was thinking about boris johnson coming out of intensive care after our previous discussion and i looked at the comments section on the youtube videos of his speech afterwards    teacher: i reviewed the comments on youtube videos of boris johnson's speech after he left intensive care, as we had discussed previously.",3,2
58907,77,"student: i thought you were talking about forums like wordreference.com forum  teacher: ah right .. no , just real stuff!    teacher: no, just factual information.",2,1
58908,77,student: i see  teacher: can i ask you to have a quick look at the youtube video now?    teacher: can you please watch the youtube video now?,3,2
58909,77,"student: yes, sure... i like reading what english people write on my english friend's walls on facebook for example  teacher: the search terms you need are: 'it could have gone either way boris johnson sky news - maybe just watch the first couple of minutes ok?    teacher: the search terms you need are: 'it could have gone either way boris johnson sky news - maybe just watch the first couple of minutes ok?",3,3
58910,77,"student: yes (about the video) i will watch it now  teacher: right yes...facebook is a good source i'm sure ok! actually, he starts thanking individuals after a couple of minutes which is quite funny!    teacher: facebook is a good source. okay. he starts thanking individuals after a couple of minutes.",3,2
58911,77,"student: i watched the first 2 minutes yes, thanking everyone for not organising barbecues in the park  teacher: ok! so you get the idea....he gets more personal later, thanking individual nurses etc (ironically they're immigrants!) i wonder <student> - is this similar to what a spanish politician would do?    teacher: is this similar to what a spanish politician would do?",3,3
58912,77,"student: yes i know, i saw him on the spanish news talking about his hero 'a portuguese nurse'  teacher: ah right ok! well anyway, i was looking at the comments section afterwards and i;ve edited some examples for you....    teacher:i have edited some examples for you after looking at the comments section.",3,2

58920,77,student: b)to be discharged from hospital (you taught me that one a few days ago ;)  teacher: most neutral meaning = just chances are he wouldn't die statistically you know?    teacher: it's unlikely that he would die based on statistics.,3,3

58962,36,"student: in i do like chocolate i can remove 'do' but in inversion we can't (if i understood well)  teacher: yes that's true of course..    teacher: yes, that is correct.",3,2
58963,36,student: okk  teacher: i guess it's a bit similar in the sense that it's related to emphasis    teacher: it is somewhat similar because it relates to emphasis.,2,1
58964,36,"student: i see  teacher: sorry i can't resist: i could have written e.g. you do know that we do sometimes say i do like chocolate?    teacher: i wanted to mention that sometimes we say ""i do like chocolate.""",3,2
58965,36,student: do do do do do do haha  teacher: 3 extra do's in one sentence    teacher: please provide 3 additional examples in one sentence.,1,1
58966,36,"student: from now i'll use 'do' all the time  teacher: yes - and actually not really exaggerated - we might really say that and it wouldn't sound strange go for it! seriously, it's much more common than we think...    teacher: yes, we can say that without it sounding strange. it's actually quite common. go ahead and try it.",3,2
58967,36,"student: same with did??  teacher: it's not always accompanied by a big dramatic tone/gesture/statment    teacher: it doesn't always come with a dramatic tone, gesture, or statement.",2,1
58968,36,"student: i mean, is it also common??  teacher: yes the same in the past and common    teacher: it is the same as before and very common.",2,2
58969,36,"student: ok  teacher: for example we often just use it to draw attention to something not in a big dramatic way for example...i did want to go out later (actually)    teacher: we use it to draw attention to something, not in a dramatic way. for example, i did want to go out later.",3,3
58970,36,"student: i see  teacher: just a gentle way of suggesting that even though maybe it's late/we're busy or whatever (not always stated) i still wan tto go out some of the phrases we invert by the way are pretty formal but not all formal ones = for example: scarcely/seldom/little more normal: not only/only then    teacher: i would like to suggest that even if it's late or we're busy, i still want to go out. some of the phrases we invert are formal, like scarcely, seldom, and little. however, there are also more normal ones, like not only and only then.",3,2
58971,36,"student: are these the adverbs that go at the beginning??  teacher: yes exactly..so e.g. seldom have i been so impressed by blah blah e.g. little did he think that he would meet him again i think <student> if you listen to more formal speaking (or read stuff like that) you'll notice it more know    teacher: yes, that's correct. for example, i have been very impressed by blah blah. also, he didn't expect to meet him again. i think if you listen to more formal speaking or read similar material, you will notice it more.",3,3
58972,36,"student: i'll pay more attention from now...  teacher: notice it more now' i mean - now that your attention has been drawn to it    teacher: i have noticed it more recently. i mean, now that you have been made aware of it.",3,2
58973,36,"student: yes, i knew what you meant  teacher: yeah - it's interesting - because it's one of those 'grammar' things that doesn;t really change the meaning so you can basically not notice it and it doesn't really matter i.e. that's why people don't notice it    teacher: it's a grammar rule that doesn't affect the meaning, so people often don't pay attention to it.",3,3
58974,36,student: i'm surprised but i don't remember studying that at all... maybe i did and i've forgotten about it  teacher: maybe you were away that lesson! it is something that's often covered quite quickly and in a self-contained kind of way    teacher: perhaps you missed that lesson. it is usually taught briefly and independently.,3,2
58975,36,"student: maybe... just to clarify...  teacher: ah - did you see my auxiliary there? i did that one without thinking (e.g. it is something that's covered...) yes go ahead you'd hear the difference in speaking (i.e. emphatic) easily    teacher: did you notice the auxiliary i used? i used it without thinking, but it is something that we have covered. you can go ahead and use it. it is easy to hear the difference in speaking when using it emphatically.",3,3
58976,36,"student: if the inverted sentence (do you call them like this) is in past simple we use did and if it is in present simple we use do  teacher: yes and yes ('inverted' =correct and do/did for present/past respectively)    teacher: correct, 'inverted' means correct and 'do/did' means present/past respectively.",3,2
58977,36,student: and...  teacher: yep...    teacher: yes...,1,0
58978,36,"student: if it's in present simple you don't use auxiliary but you invert the order (have he...) but for present or past simple you don't invert the order (did he think...) sorry, i meant present perfect simple when i wrote the example (have he...)  teacher: ah right i see hold on...    teacher: i understand, please wait...",2,2
58979,36,"student: am i right?? i deduced that from your examples but no idea...  teacher: well, in the present perfect the auxiliary is 'have' right? so, e.g. not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied blah blah same idea in the present = not only does he steal from me he...ok? nice verb 'deduced' by the way!    teacher: in the present perfect, the auxiliary is 'have'. for example, not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied. the same idea in the present is not only does he steal from me he... is that okay? by the way, nice verb 'deduced'!",3,4
58980,36,student: i see!! have is the auxiliary...  teacher: yes that's it    teacher: that is correct.,2,1
58981,36,student: deduce: deducir en espaol ;)  teacher: yeah i guess that's an easy one then! is it formal in spanish?    teacher: is it formal in spanish?,2,2
58982,36,"student: it's not really formal, we use it a lot...  teacher: oh right - it's a bit formal in english educated' or whatever    teacher: english is more formal, like being educated or something.",2,2
58983,36,student: and do you have an informal word for that?  teacher: some people might never say it i guess...    teacher: some people might not say it.,2,1
58984,36,"student: maybe 'guess'?  teacher: um ..well i guess like lots of these things it would be replaced by a phrasal verb often - so e.g. work out or guess of vourse yes but 'work out' is maybe best here i just mean more common    teacher: phrasal verbs, like ""work out,"" often replace ""guess."" it's a more common option.",3,3
58985,36,"student: ok, thanks could we practise the inverted sentences a bit?  teacher: because it's like a little process you know? 'guess' i soften just a quick little or one-step thing yes sure - i'll give you a prompt ok? unless you have an idea of your own first?    teacher: it's a simple process. i'll give you a prompt unless you have your own idea.",3,2
58986,36,"student: sure, i see the difference between guess and work out. i sometimes struggle to use phrasal verbs because i don't know where to write the thing i worked out... maybe we could talk about that another day, sorry (mixing topics)  teacher: yes! well most are 'separable' so e.g. work out something or work something out = both correct    teacher: most phrasal verbs can be separated. for example, ""work out something"" and ""work something out"" are both correct.",3,3
58987,36,"student: about a prompt, yes please ahhh, i thought there was a rule about it!!  teacher: ok so e.g.: i haven't had so much fun since i was in spain. can you invert that?    teacher: can you invert the sentence ""i haven't had so much fun since i was in spain""?",3,2
58988,36,student: little fun have i had since i was in spain??  teacher: yes i see your idea...start with 'not since...'    teacher: i understand your idea. begin with 'not since...',3,2
58989,36,"student: it's difficult!!!  teacher: so it's the 3-word negative bit you've got to ivert invert imean e.g. i haven;t had not since i was...    teacher: you need to invert the 3-word negative phrase. for example, ""i haven't had"" should be ""not since i was...""",2,3
58990,36,"student: not since i was in spain haven't i had so much fun not sure!  teacher: yes good! you've already got the negative with 'not' at the beginning though so: 'haven't i had'?    teacher: correct. you have already used the negative form with 'not' at the beginning. so, it should be 'haven't i had'?",3,3
58991,36,student: not since i was in spain have i had so much fun??  teacher: yes exactly ...you made your first little baby inversion....    teacher: you made an inversion.,3,2

59249,127,"teacher: that's nice, that you can switch between languages so easily in your household  student: i remember you talking about a child...here they are trying to do that too...the children are starting to go do a 'tagesmutter' (essentially a baby sitter at home, who can take up to 4 children and is inserted into the social system through financial aids etc.), but now they are home again since the tagesmutter might have covid lukily my wife is still home, so she can take care of the kids, at least to an extent...    student: the children were going to a tagesmutter, but now they are back home because the tagesmutter might have covid. luckily, my wife is still home and can take care of the kids to some extent.",3,4
59250,127,"teacher: it's a 'childminder' in english. do the kids like it? at the childminder's i mean  student: (i am still here, there was a connection problem so the chat thought there were two <students> logged in)    student: i am still here. there was a connection problem, so the chat system thought there were two students logged in.",2,1
59251,127,"teacher: oh yes, it does that, i can see you had to re-enter a couple of times  student: i see...never heard this term before: in italian it doesn't exist at all...they love it! she is a very nice girl, and has two children who love to play with our children. and it is also good for them: this way they can learn german...    student: i learned a new term that doesn't exist in italian. they really like it. she is a nice girl with two children who enjoy playing with our children. it's good for them because they can learn german this way.",2,3
59252,127,"teacher: oh wonderful, so it's just her children and yours then? here too, childminders have a limit on how many children they can look after and they are 'competitively priced', that is they are usually no more expensive than a nursery/ pre-school and you can use your funded hours towards fees  student: for now yes...actually her children go to school so in the morning they currently are alone, but a new child might come. actually, there was an attempt but the child's mother was too protective: a child of almost two years who wouldn't eat anything solid, not even a banana... here they are a bit more expensive than nursery, but we couldn't get into nursery because my wife is unenployed (she received just now the recognition of her degree to work here as a nurse). and there is some priority list: so we were excluded because of the number limit which, i believe, was reduced also because of covid.    student: yes, currently her children are alone in the morning because they go to school. there was an attempt to have another child join, but the child's mother was too protective. the child is almost two years old and refuses to eat solid food, even a banana. childcare here is more expensive than nursery, but we couldn't get into nursery because my wife is unemployed. she just received recognition of her degree to work as a nurse here. we were excluded from the priority list due to the number limit, which i think was reduced because of covid.",3,4
59253,127,"teacher: so if a parent isn't working, the family might be refused a place at a nursery? but that's a vicious circle, they will never be able to start work then! here they are a bit more expensive than nursery; and there is some priority list  student: indeed...we also wrote something about my wife looking for a job as soon as she received the proper papers...but still, at least there are childminers.    student: we also mentioned my wife searching for a job once she got the necessary documents. but at least there are childminers.",3,3
59254,127,teacher: could you have a look at these parts of sentences? some articles are missing  student: here they are a bit more expensive than a nursery...i believe...    student: they cost more here than a nursery. i think.,2,2
59255,127,"teacher: yes, sure! i know with 'some' you probably mean 'some kind of a', right?  student: as for the second one i am not sure...maybe: 'and there is some list of priorities', but this would change the meaning a bit... oh, yes indeed, there is some kind of a priority list, that would be okay. what i wrote was more of a word-by-word translation from italian...    student:i'm not sure about the second one. maybe it could be ""and there is a list of priorities,"" but that might change the meaning a little. oh, yes. there is a priority list of some kind, and that would be fine. what i wrote was just a direct translation from italian.",3,3
59256,127,"teacher: you can say colloquially, 'there's some list somewhere' or something like that, so it's not terribly wrong, just you seem to stick to quite formal english, and it stood out for me ah, that would explain it, a translation from italian shall we have another look at the writing you sent me?  student: i should use 'some kind of' when i don't know an exact description, right? like there is some kind of regulation you must follow... yes!    student: should i use 'some kind of' when i don't know an exact description? like there is some kind of regulation you must follow... yes!",3,2
59257,127,"teacher: not necessarily, you can use 'some' with a singular countable noun. just thinking of an example some mr johnson called this morning' to say 'i have no idea which mr johnson' or you can use 'a' there a mr johnson caleed this morning' *called again, to express that you don't know who he is  student: okay, got it thank you!    student: understood, thanks!",3,1
59258,127,"teacher: or, 'it was the mr johnson' (the one we've been talking about / thinking about) anyway, elon musk! i would have said 'the elon musk' if he had a more common name, but it's not like there are many people with this name around the = that one, the one who created tesla a beautiful inside view in the life of a man who seems capable of almost everything, that is running multiple complex enterprises which are shaping the world.  student: that -&gt; who right? the one after the comma    student: can you clarify if ""that"" should be changed to ""who""? also, i need to know which one comes after the comma.",4,3
59259,127,"teacher: ah, did you mean 'that' as 'who'?? yes, who would be much better in this case because otherwise there is an ambiguity that is' reads as an explanation of the phrase before it like 'i.e.' does this make sense?  student: as always italian is the problem: in this context the italian word for 'that' and 'who' is the same...    student: the italian word for 'that' and 'who' is the same in this context.",3,2
59260,127,"teacher: this child won't eat any solids, i.e. she only eats liquidized food  student: i see it makes sense...if i wanted to write 'i.e.' then what would have been the problem?    student: if i wanted to write 'i.e.' what would have been the problem?",2,3

59266,127,"teacher: this sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but it also doesn't read very well. for starters, could you change the direct question into an indirect one?  student: ...(which is) to focus more on how to solve a problem    student: ...to focus on problem-solving techniques more.",3,2
59267,127,"teacher: you can use 'that' for 'who'. the problem was that it was creating an ambiguity in your sentence  student: i think i would also need to add 'which is' after the comma okay, 'that + is' might be unclear, i'll remember this    student: i need to add 'which is' after the comma. i should remember that 'that + is' might be unclear.",3,3
59268,127,"teacher: yes, i totally read it as 'i.e.' rather than 'who' when a problem comes, which is to focus... is this what you mean?  student: i am trying to refer to the attitude...    student: i need help with referring to the attitude...",2,2
59269,127,"teacher: it's a good suggestion, i like it  student: haha, thank you what about the indirect question...was 'how to solve a problem' what you were thinking of?    student: thank you for your response. were you considering the indirect question ""how to solve a problem""?",2,3

59272,127,"teacher: it would just read more smoothly. also, if you read you text out loud to someone who couldn't see the '' '', there would be a grammatical mistake no worries, like you say, that's why we are here and one last thing with this sentence! his attitude, which is to focus on ... rather than find a scapegoat and complain not finding and complaining because you need a parallel structure there to focus (infinitive), find (infinitive) and complain (infinitive)  student: oh, i see! if you write only the very, the structure is clear...    student: i understand. if you only write ""very,"" the structure is clear...",3,2

59290,219,"teacher: ok, why did you go for a in 35?  student: to begin, i don't know the meaning of the expression: 'this was something of a plum', but i guess it means something along the lines 'this was a positive thing' .referred to her age.. i realize now that, if this is the case, probably c would be more suitable...    student: i don't understand the phrase 'this was something of a plum', but i think it means something good. it might be better to choose option c.",3,3

59294,219,"teacher: yes, absolutely! there is 'evidence' for each correct answer in the text. if a candidate is taking a paper-based version of the test, it might be useful to underline it for example, you would underline 'she must have got the job on her merits' and put '35' next to it  student: i see, that makes sense...especially when reviewing at the end .if there is time for it!.    student: i understand, especially during the end review if there is enough time.",4,3

59313,219,"teacher: ok, let's leave 41 for now. what about 42? there's a very clear link in the first sentence of the following paragraph  student: 42 a the paragraph ends talking about a bigger project covering 50 square kilometers and a starts talking about a more ambitious scheme    student: 42 a the paragraph mentions a larger project that covers 50 square kilometers. a then discusses a more ambitious plan.",3,3

59322,30,student: how do you say 'passing the days'?? do you have an expression for that?  teacher: um...not really i guess the translation could be ...e.g. 'surviving' or 'getting by'    teacher:the translation could be 'surviving' or 'getting by'.,3,3
59323,30,"student: exactly that... surviving how about you?  teacher: well...surviving i guess! i'm at home now and basically 'social distancing' is the new norm so pretty limited also i hurt my knee which is annoying (poor me)    teacher:i am currently at home practicing social distancing. my activities are limited. additionally, i injured my knee, which is quite bothersome.",4,2

59326,30,student: hope you get better soon  teacher: yeah thanks - it's ok - mind over matter - i;m serious you know? it's a good mental test as in it's the way you look at things right?    teacher: thank you. it's fine. it's about having control over your thoughts. i'm being serious. it's a mental challenge. it's about your perspective.,3,2
59327,30,"student: yes, i know what you mean... i feel the same. i just went to exercise a bit inside my building but we're not suppose to...  teacher: not even inside? you mean on the stairs or something?    teacher: are you asking if the activity can be done outside of the classroom, like on the stairs?",2,3
59328,30,"student: no :(. i don't understand why not. i just talked to one of my neighbours and he told me (in a good way) that if i do it, everyone would do it too. and i really think that we could plan a half and hour-walk for everyone during the day... half-and-hour-walk?  teacher: a half-hour walk (you mean 30 minutes right?)    teacher: please confirm if a half-hour walk means 30 minutes.",3,2
59329,30,student: hehe i see  teacher: and how about a simlar phrase for 90 minutes? can iyou try it?    teacher: can you try coming up with a similar phrase for 90 minutes?,3,1
59330,30,"student: we could have a ninety-minute walk ??  teacher: yes fine thanks just checking! yes you'd think there'd be a way to manage soemthing    teacher: i am doing well, thank you for asking. i am just checking in. it seems like there should be a way to handle something.",2,2
59331,30,student: thank you!! it's so different in spanish  teacher: sure i remember having problems the other way round hey <student>...are you still planning (or did you do) to do a cae exam?    teacher:are you still planning to take the cae exam?,3,3
59332,30,"student: i'm sure... i think it's important that we go out a bit for our mental and fisical health fisical health is not right, how do you say it?  teacher: yes i agree - mental health is important - oh sure physical! although often when we mean physical health we just say 'health' of course shows you the bias towards that side of things    teacher: i agree that mental health is important, but physical health is often referred to simply as ""health,"" which shows a bias towards the physical side.",3,3
59333,30,"student: about the cae exam, a month ago i decided to postpone it. i was doing too many things and i was very stressed... i couldn't sleep well. so i decided to postpone what wasn't urgent  teacher: yes i see - sounds like it was a good idea - i guess it's not possible to do the exams at the moment anyway...    teacher: i understand. it seems like a good idea. currently, it is not possible to conduct exams.",3,2
59334,30,student: i suddenly now i have soooo much free time... haha live is showing us that we shouldn't plan so much  teacher: yes that's true....i guess we've been pampered for decades    teacher: that is correct. we have been spoiled for many years.,3,1
59335,30,student: sure  teacher: we can't cope without our routines... and the state doing lots of things for us    teacher: routines are important and the state provides assistance.,3,0
59336,30,student: but it'd be great (if you want) to keep looking at cae exercises  teacher: not that i'm complaining exactly! yes of course we can do that if you like...    teacher: we can do that if you want.,3,1
59337,30,"student: sure!! thanks  teacher: i have the book with me - do you want to have a go now? page 130 for example?    teacher: i have the book. do you want to start now? page 130, for instance?",3,2
59338,30,"student: me too :) no idea about 17  teacher: ah ok - it's an adjective meanign they had influence - does that help?    teacher: okay, it's an adjective that means they had influence. does that help?",4,3
59339,30,student: let me think... influential??  teacher: adjective endings.....-ive/-ous--ial ...choose one of these! yes you've got it - well done    teacher: choose between -ive and -ous/-ial for adjective endings. you got it right. good job.,3,4
59340,30,"student: great clues! thank you  teacher: and you didn't say influencial which is a common spanish mistake    teacher: you didn't mention ""influencial,"" which is a common mistake in spanish.",3,3

59342,30,student: 19 generosity  teacher: great    teacher: good,1,1
59343,30,"student: 20 restless??  teacher: yes right idea for the meaning = good but you need a noun i.e. the thing that led him... add a noun ending to your adjective    teacher: you have the correct idea for the meaning, but you need to include a noun. this noun should be the thing that led him. please add a noun ending to your adjective.",3,3
59344,30,student: ness?  teacher: yes that's right!    teacher: correct.,2,1
59345,30,"student: really?? restlessness?? i didn't know that word exists  teacher: yes really...e.g. hopelessness/restlessness/homelessness etc fearlessness! remember that with the schwa sound it's quick when people say it - maybe looks more weird that it sounds... or maybe not to you i don;t know!    teacher: examples of words with the schwa sound are hopelessness, restlessness, and homelessness. another example is fearlessness. when people say the schwa sound, it is quick. it may look strange but sound normal to you, i don't know.",3,3
59346,30,"student: i guessed it because yesterday i listened to a esther perel podcast called 'sexlessness'. do you know her? she is great, i think... she is a therapist  teacher: no i don't actually - but there you go - good extensive listening    teacher: no, i don't have it. but there you go. good extensive listening.",2,2
59347,30,"student: yes, i see how important is to keep listening and reading things in english well, i'll continue  teacher: yes it's the one thing really you can do    teacher: yes, it's the only thing you can do.",2,1

59351,30,"student: no idea about 24 (is this sentence correct? is there a better way of saying that i don't know the answer??)  teacher: um you 'no idea about' is fine and common don't worry...apart from that...i haven't got a clue is common    teacher: your lack of knowledge on the subject is normal and nothing to be concerned about. other than that, i am completely clueless.",3,3
59352,30,"student: okk  teacher: yes i guessed 24 would be tough - it's ;outcry' - have you seen that before?    teacher: it seems that 24 was difficult for you. the answer is ""outcry."" have you encountered this word previously?",3,2
59353,30,"student: no, never  teacher: it's like protest/controversy/opposition as the noun form of 'cry out' (in pain/anger etc) bit germanic i guess!    teacher: the word ""protest"" is similar to the noun form of ""cry out"" and it has some controversy and opposition associated with it. it has a germanic origin.",3,3
59354,30,"student: i understan, thanks  teacher: there are lots of verbs/nouns with 'out' that don't come so easilly to mind for you perhaps    teacher: there are many verbs and nouns with 'out' that you may not readily remember.",3,2
59355,30,"student: i'm sure...  teacher: as in some will be in your passive knowledge but perhaps not used so much in my experience with e.g. italians/spanish/french etc for obvious reasons    teacher: some words may be known to you but not used often, based on my experience with italians, spanish, french, etc.",3,2
59356,30,"student: can you give an example? i can't think of any  teacher: yes sure ..hold on... so verbs first ...maybe a bit easier cos there are more perhaps so if i run faster than you ...i _______ you (one-word verb answer) ?    teacher: verbs first. if i run faster than you, what word describes what i do to you?",3,3
59357,30,"student: pass overtake ? not sure  teacher: ah well possible i guess - as in the moment itself - but more generally we can say 'outrun' by the way overtake good idea and very common (but still only for the moment itself)    teacher: it is possible to outrun someone in the moment, but generally we can use the word 'overtake' which is a common term. however, it only refers to the moment itself.",3,3
59358,30,"student: another new word for me!!  teacher: lots of spanish speakers just say pass - good to have thought of overtake = very natural but yes 'outrun' = normal too so good to know what about e.g. score more points than?    teacher: some spanish speakers say ""pass"" instead of ""overtake."" it's natural. ""outrun"" is also normal. what about ""score more points than""?",3,2
59359,30,student: no idea  teacher: outscore! and: fight harder than?    teacher: please try to score higher and put in more effort.,2,1
59360,30,"student: outfight??  teacher: yes! be more than (in number)    teacher: yes, please provide a number greater than the current amount.",4,2
59361,30,"student: but i don't know how to use these words!! for example, can i say 'my team outscored more points than yours'?  teacher: well for example....if mnachester united beat barcelona 5-0 then the sports report might say that they outfought, outran, outmuscled, outscored, outplayed barcelona any combination of these verbs! and others too!    teacher: if manchester united beats barcelona 5-0, the sports report might say they were better in every way.",3,3
59362,30,"student: i see  teacher: bit more formal than some phrases but still you'll hear these words a fair bit    teacher: some phrases are more formal, but you will hear these words often.",3,1
59363,30,"student: so the example i wrote is not correct, is it?  teacher: by the way 'outnumber' was the last one - this is really common...as in e.g. males outnumber females in senior managemnt roles (or whatever!) sorry - which example are you saying wasn't correct?    teacher: the word ""outnumber"" was the last one. it is commonly used to describe a situation where there are more males than females in senior management roles. which example are you saying was incorrect?",3,2
59364,30,"student: i'll try to correct it... my team outscored yours last night before your examples, i wrote one  teacher: oh sorry i see it now! yes you just need to say 'outscore' because this already includes the idea of 'points' this is why it's quite efficent you see! german!    teacher: i understand now. just say 'outscore' because it already includes the idea of 'points'. it's efficient. german!",3,3
59365,30,student: now i got it... i think haha yes  teacher: ok one more ...so apple has sold more devices than anyone else = apple has hugely _______ other tech companies    teacher: apple has sold more devices than any other tech company.,3,2
59366,30,"student: in germany then can still go out for walks with one person... i think they are much more sensible than spanish people...  teacher: yes i guess if you pick a limited number (or just one) of people and then stick with them it would be ok right? i feel bad because my daughter won't be able to play with her friends for months potentially this is the same in spain right? as in kids can't play with anyone? sorry i got sucked into the madness of the 'situation'    teacher: is it okay if you choose a few people or just one person to be around during this time? my daughter won't be able to play with her friends for a while, which makes me feel bad. is it the same in spain? are kids not allowed to play with anyone? sorry, i got caught up in the chaos of the current situation.",3,3
59367,30,"student: i actually don't know, maybe it's the right way to stop the virus but it's very hard for everyone...  teacher: yes - it'll be very difficult i'm sure - maybe people will start rebelling after a while i don;t know you know it's weird in the uk because we have no history of the state really being able to tell us what to do do you see?    teacher: it will likely be challenging, and there may be resistance over time. in the uk, the state has not traditionally had much control over our actions.",3,2
59368,30,"student: about your daughter and children in general, i know it's really hard but then i think of children who live in siria for example where they can leave their houses because there are bombs and i think that we are lucky...  teacher: so e.g. the realtionship with the police is kind of contractual no of course you're right...it's all relative! i should take my own advice and change my perspective!    teacher: the relationship with the police is contractual. it is relative and i should change my perspective.",1,1

66108,12,"student: happy new year! good, thank you.  teacher: great - how was your christmas - did you stay in cambridge?    teacher: that's good to hear. did you spend your christmas in cambridge?",3,2
66109,12,"student: no, we went to mallorca island... it was very warm and sunny! how was your trip to the lake district?  teacher: oh right yes - i remember now you said you were going away! what did you think of mallorca?    teacher: oh, yes, i recall you mentioned going on a trip. what were your impressions of mallorca?",4,3
66110,12,student: there were beautiful beaches and i felt really relaxed as few people were there.  teacher: right that sounds lovely i spent a few years living in spain and i do miss it sometimes!    teacher: i spent a few years living in spain and i sometimes miss it.,3,2
66111,12,"student: oh really! was it for your work?  teacher: well yes basically - i just taught in different schools    teacher: yes, it was for work. i taught in various schools.",2,3
66112,12,"student: then you must miss sunshine during winter.  teacher: yeah i do miss the sun! <student>: 'few people' = formal or normal?    teacher: yeah, i do miss the sun! <student> is 'few people' considered formal or informal?",3,2
66113,12,student: i thought it's normal... but formal?  teacher: a bit yes....can you tell me the thing you said about mallorca in a different way? the thing about few people i mean    teacher: can you rephrase your comment about mallorca and the number of people there?,3,3
66114,12,"student: not many people were there... but it sounds different.  teacher: in meaning you mean? it's ok - it has the same meaning (but sounds different yes because it's less formal!) look, this is what i had already written to reply to your earlier question!: yes the lake district was lovely not warm and sunny! but the weather wasnt too bad. there arent quite so many people in winter either so its a bit more peaceful you know? #    teacher: yes, the lake district was pleasant. the weather was not warm and sunny, but it was tolerable. there were not as many people in winter, so it was more peaceful.",4,3
66115,12,"student: hmm... i thought few people mean that we rarely see people.  teacher: by the way, 'there weren't many people' is a more common order than 'not many people were there' um...'few' by itself doesn't give information about frequency how can you say the opposite? i.e. in winter there aren't many people but in summer...    teacher: by the way, the order ""there weren't many people"" is more commonly used than ""not many people were there"". also, ""few"" alone does not indicate frequency. how can you express the opposite? for example, in winter there aren't many people, but in summer...",4,2
66116,12,"student: i see. it sounds like 'few' is fewer than 'not many', but it's the same, right? in summer there are many people.  teacher: ah yes of course i see what you mean - yes it is a bit confusing i guess but yes you're absolutely right many people' = formal or normal    teacher: ah yes, i understand your point. it can be a bit confusing, but you are correct. ""few"" and ""not many"" have the same meaning. in summer, there are many people.   many people' = formal or normal",4,3
66117,12,"student: normal  teacher: well....a bit formal to be honest! can you think of another way of saying it?    teacher: it is a bit formal, to be honest. can you think of another way to express it?",3,2
66118,12,"student: oh, really! in summer, there were a lot of people. were are  teacher: yeah that's it! just to be clear: few and many are perfectly correct and fine but...you will hear people use (not) many and lots much more often i mean in normal speaking    teacher: yes, that is correct. 'few' and 'not many' have the same meaning. in summer, there are many people.",3,3
66119,12,"student: i see. so these words sound more natural, right? i mean in daily conversation.  teacher: yes exactly - in most normal situations (for most people!) next time you speak to someone (a native speaker) you'll notice if you think about it!    teacher: yes, exactly. in most normal situations, for most people, you will notice if you think about it next time you speak to someone who is a native speaker.",3,2
66120,12,"student: thank you for telling me. that's very helpful for me.  teacher: no problem - quick practice <student>: tell me about somewhere you've been in the uk with large and small numbers of people    teacher: you're welcome. quick practice, <student> tell me about somewhere you've been in the uk with large and small numbers of people.",4,3

66124,12,student: a lot of but didn't you say 'lots' is used more often?  teacher: also correct (no difference) ...what about 'loads'? do you use this word?    teacher: is 'loads' a word you use?,3,2
66125,12,"student: i've never heard 'loads'...  teacher: really? ok, it's really common seriously - i bet you'll notice it now i've mentioned it!    teacher: really? ok, it's quite common - i believe you will become aware of it now that i have mentioned it.",3,2
66126,12,"student: oh,thank you.  teacher: it's common in normal informal speech - also can be quite emphatic as in lots and lots!    teacher: it is common in normal informal speech. it can also be quite emphatic, like saying lots and lots.",3,1
66127,12,"student: so is it used like 'there are loads of people in london' ?  teacher: yeah absolutely... or e.g. i went to the swimming pool - there were loads of peopel because it's the school holidays...ok <student> one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal? people of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too    teacher: yeah, definitely... or for example, i went to the swimming pool - there were a lot of people because it's the school holidays... okay, <student> one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal? people of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too",3,2
66128,12,student: i think it's normal.  teacher: ok...it's certainly perfectly possible and correct...can you think of a different word?!    teacher: it is possible and correct to use 'rarely' in normal speech. can you think of another word?,3,1
66129,12,"student: seldom?  teacher: good idea! so in order of formality: seldom, rarely and hardly ever you've heard that before?    teacher: that's a good idea! so, in order of formality seldom, rarely, and hardly ever. have you heard that before?",3,3
66130,12,"student: so you mean hardly is the most casual? i know these words, but i've never thought about the order of formality.  teacher: yes ' hardly ever' (two words together) is by far the most common in normal speaking. just to clarify: 'seldom' = correct but very formal i.e. many english people will never have said it in their lives!    teacher: yes, ""hardly ever"" (two words together) is the most common in normal speaking. just to clarify, ""seldom"" is correct but very formal, meaning many english people will never have said it in their lives.",4,4
66131,12,"student: hardly + ever', i see... he hardly ever comes to school on time. like that?  teacher: yep perfect example - and by far the most common form you would hear in everyday life - quick pronunciation question <student>: can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' as in opposite of uncle and 'aren't' (are not)    teacher:yes, that's a perfect example. it is the most common form you would hear in everyday life. now, let's move on to a pronunciation question. can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' and 'aren't'?",4,4
66132,12,"student: yes, i can... aren't has 'r' sound.  teacher: for most british people?    teacher:for most british people?",3,2
66133,12,"student: what do you mean? do they sound the same in theuk?  teacher: yes exactly they sound exactly the same for me so e.g. both are: /nt/ sorry, do you understand the phonemic symbols?    teacher:yes, they sound the same in the uk. both are pronounced as /nt/. do you understand the phonemic symbols?",3,3
66134,12,"student: oh, really!? is that like a dialect? i can understand the phonemic symbols.  teacher: but of course you can say them how you like <student>! (as in with an /r/ if you like - i'm just pointing it out for understanding! and americans and many other english speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! i like the idea of you telling english peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most english people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral english accent - do you see? that's great you can read the symbols by the way - very useful now i can write more stuff!    teacher: yes, it can be considered a dialect. however, you can pronounce them however you like. i'm just pointing out the difference for understanding. americans and many other english speakers pronounce it with an ""r,"" but generally not in cambridge. it's standard for most english people, especially in the south, and is often regarded as having a neutral english accent. do you see?by the way, it's great that you can read the symbols. they are very useful. now, i can provide more information.",3,4
66135,12,"student: i see, in japan there are a lot of dialect, but in the uk, there are many kinds of accent...  teacher: right i see. you know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary right? so in the uk there aren't really many different dialects left but yes 0 as you say - lots of different accents have you noticed/heard any difference in accents in the uk    teacher: right i see. you know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary, right? so in the uk there aren't really many different dialects left, but yes, as you say, there are lots of different accents. have you noticed or heard any difference in accents in the uk?",4,3
66136,12,"student: interesting. hmm... my friend said 'scone' has two accents. 'sco:n' and 'scoun'/// i'm not sure if the symbols are correct  teacher: ah i see - a classic example! yes good one! i guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? as in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word! and peopel who choose the same verision of that word might still have a different accent if you see what i mean?! version    teacher: ah, i see - a classic example! yes, a good one. i suppose that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more of a matter of pronunciation rather than accent. people with essentially the same accent may disagree about that specific word. and even people who choose the same version of that word may still have a different accent, if you understand what i mean.",4,3
66137,12,"student: sorry, i cannot understand. what is the difference?  teacher: so if i say /skn/ (and i do!) an e.g. scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are scottish and a person from the south of egnland like me might say /skn/ (not like me) but i would still hear that they have the same accent as me in general sorry <student> - have i confused you more?!    teacher: so if i say /skn/ (and i do!) and a scottish person says it that way too, i would still recognize that they are scottish. similarly, a person from the south of england like me might say /skn/ (not like me), but i would still recognize that they have the same accent as me in general. i apologize if i have further confused you, <student>.",3,2
66138,12,"student: oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as i don't know the background!  teacher: ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. americans normally have an /r/ and most english people don't but the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing one more <student> - a really big accent thing: in the south of england we say /a:/ as in /b/ and in the north they say //    teacher: the /r/ thing is a significant difference between american and english pronunciation. however, the pronunciation of the word ""scone"" is a matter of debate and not necessarily related to accents or regions. another example of accent variation is the pronunciation of the vowel sound in words like ""bath,"" with the south of england using /a/ and the north using //.",3,2
66139,12,"student: i see. i got it. ah, how about the word 'staff'? in american english it sounds like /staef/ but in the uk it sounds like /sta:f/  teacher: ha! yes great ecample!!!!!!!! example the same as in america in the north of the uk but less nasal!    teacher: yes, that is correct. the word 'staff' is pronounced as /staef/ in american english and as /staf/ in uk english.",3,3

66333,257,"student: well, for me it is important to understand what i listen to or what i read, even if i dont know the word, i can understand it from the other text, by the way, i want to know more about the difference between different english countries is cornwall a city? wow, you will have only one month of holiday! why?  teacher: cornwall is a county. do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the uk being divided into counties? it's like 'oblast'    teacher: cornwall is a county. do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the uk being divided into counties? it's similar to an 'oblast'.",3,2
66334,257,"student: oh yeah  teacher: schoolchildren in this country only get 6 weeks of summer holidays, yes! if you imagine the map of the uk, cornwall is in the bottom left corner :)    teacher: cornwall is located in the bottom left corner of the map of the uk.",3,1

66336,257,"student: yes! at least i know it from the texts from english books, not from geography lesson!  teacher: yes, sure, it should be in your english texts! ok, to go back to understanding what you hear and what you read in english! the key to understanding is words. i really believe there's no way round it, to learn a language you need to learn lots of new words (and i also think this is the fun part, too!) i really recommend a good dictionary. lots of people use online translations, but a good english-english dictionary that explains instead of translating can do so much more! i always recommend cambridge english dictionary online. you can listen to the pronunciation there too and there are pictures and quizzes!    teacher: to understand what you hear and read in english, it is important to learn new words. i recommend using a good english-english dictionary, such as the cambridge english dictionary online. it provides explanations, pronunciation, pictures, and quizzes.",3,3
66337,257,"student: yes , i know that translation words is not as good as understanding them, for example when you speak you remember the translation, not the word  teacher: exactly! and then just use your favourite way to memorize words, maybe an app or a notebook or post-it notes how do you prefer to learn new words?    teacher: the key to understanding is words. learning a language requires learning many new words. i recommend using a good dictionary, such as the cambridge english dictionary online, which provides explanations, pronunciation, pictures, and quizzes. it is important to understand words rather than relying on translations. find your preferred method of memorizing words, whether it be through an app, a notebook, or post-it notes. how do you prefer to learn new words?",4,4

66339,257,"student: if i need to study them i just repeat them a lot of times and if i dont know the meaning i google it also i have a vocabulary notebook, i write words there from the fifth form  teacher: sounds perfect!    teacher: sounds acceptable.",3,1
66340,257,"student: but it is for school, so there are not meanings, just translation  teacher: in terms of listening, the trick to understanding is actually pronunciation! once you start to understand how english pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it! sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right?    teacher: in terms of listening, understanding english pronunciation is crucial. once you grasp the mechanics of english pronunciation, your comprehension of spoken english will significantly improve.",4,2
66341,257,"student: yes  teacher: we haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :) but! there's a really nice series on the bbc learning english website it's called tim's pronunciation workshop it's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully    teacher: we haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously ) but! there's a series on the bbc learning english website called tim's pronunciation workshop. it's useful and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word carefully.",4,3
66342,257,"student: i will also check it later i found the site  teacher: you can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know perfect! there's lots of fun stuff to do there, too! and of course, if you'd like a project, i always recommend reading in english (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the hp books are perfect for this the first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. by the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in english and it's easier for you anyway! the way i used to approach reading in english was to learn every single new word at first! it's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! there are usually very few new words by the end of the book    teacher: you can find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know. there are lots of activities available on the website. additionally, reading in english and learning new words is recommended. the first two books of the hp series are written for younger readers and have simpler language. by the time you reach the third book, reading becomes easier due to prior experience. when reading in english, it is suggested to learn every new word initially. although it may be challenging and slow progress, after a few chapters, it becomes easier as there are fewer new words.",3,4
66343,257,"student: i think i will try maybe not the whole book something not long  teacher: yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes!    teacher: yes, you can start with a slower pace and assess your progress.",3,1
66344,257,"student: i think somebody gave me an english book as a gift  teacher: obviously, if there's a blog / insta / tik tok account that you like in english, that could be perfect for smaller texts    teacher: if there's a blog / insta / tik tok account that you like in english, that could be perfect for smaller texts.",3,2

66365,190,"teacher: we talked about play up / play down, didn't we?  student: yes, even though i can't remember exactly the meaning and i am pretty sure children weren't involved    student: yes, we did discuss play up / play down, but i cannot recall the exact meaning. i am fairly certain that children were not involved.",3,2

66373,190,"teacher: oh, this is an interesting comment, on the fluidity / rigidity of the class system the mistake is assuming that the middle class is closer to the upper class than to the working class. losing one's job can make you go from middle class to working class in a heartbeat, but most will never even be close to the upper class even if they spend a lifetime doing very well. i think there are two nice expressions here, but which one would you pick? ones  student: in a hartbeat'...meaning in a very short time    student: in a very short time",3,2

66376,190,"teacher: exactly! covid cost so many people their livelihoods ok, one last i admit it's not rocket science sociology. but the government probably need a commission to help them to understand this. so i hope the writer is doing his bit there. have you heard the expression 'it's not rocket science'?  student: yes, to be honest i think it is used more often in the us, could that be the case? anyway, it means 'it is nothing that complex'    student: yes, it is possible that the expression 'it's not rocket science' is used more frequently in the us. in any case, it means 'it is not something that is very complex'.",3,4
66377,190,"teacher: hmm, i would say it's used in the uk as well! yes, of course! what's a synonymous expression? 'it's not ___ ___' that is another field of knowledge  student: oh... i really don't know...i know many people think math is hard, so i would guess 'it's not like math' but it doesn't sound right    student: oh... i am not aware of any synonymous expression. i know some individuals perceive math as difficult, so i would assume 'it's not like math' but it does not sound accurate.",3,3
66378,190,"teacher: nope, but good guess! the expression is 'it's not brain surgery' i've got to remember to send you a link to a comedy sketch about these two expressions after class  student: i am pretty sure i had never hear that one...okay!    student: i am not familiar with that expression. okay.",3,2

66381,190,"teacher: there is an english comedy website that does always cheer me up, it's called the daily mash. it kind of mimics a newspaper, but the news is satire  student: another example is checco zalone, his comedy is actually a bit better...    student: another example is checco zalone, his comedy is slightly superior.",3,1
66382,190,"teacher: it especially likes to make fun of middle class people ah, i'm with you, there are awful awful awful comedy shows on tv in the uk, they make me blush too! and they also seem to culminate around christmas  student: i'll give it a look! we also have such satirical papers in italian, i guess the most well known is 'lercio' meaning 'filthy'...but to be honest some of their pages are good, and the name is more of a pun with 'leggo' (i read) which is a newspaper.    student: i will take a look at it. we also have satirical papers in italian, the most well known being 'lercio' which means 'filthy'...but some of their pages are good, and the name is a pun with 'leggo' which is a newspaper.",3,3

66384,190,"teacher: embarrassing' would probably be a good one here  student: okay...yes, i wasn't really sure how to express that...i find italian comedy often embarrassing    student: okay...yes, i wasn't really sure how to express that...i find italian comedy often embarrassing.",3,1
66385,190,"teacher: hmm, actually, i wonder if americans are more concerned with swearing than brits brits love to swear, including on tv yes, and a good collocation is 'excrutiatingly embarrassing'  student: really? i had never noticed...but then, i don't watch much tv from the uk...    student: i had not previously observed that...however, i do not watch a significant amount of television from the united kingdom...",4,2

66935,62,teacher: um...'adults' is ok if you're talking about adults in general! hold on your noun is 'some games' and this is fine...but what comes next? singular or plural?  student: are,3,2
66936,62,teacher: ok good and the next word you have to change to the plural?? again it connects back to 'some games' a tiny little word...! you ok <student>? ok sorry - i'll help! you need to change 'it' to 'they' oh maybe you're having internet issues?!  student: sorry.. so...because some games are for adults to forget pressured and sometime it may have violent contents.    student: because some games are for adults to forget pressure and sometimes they may have violent content.,3,3
66937,62,"teacher: ok good ...thanks <student> ...small grammar changes it's true but i want you to get into the habit of seeing these mistakes so you change them (and eventually not make them in the first place!)  student: yes,, i will get them into my habit,thanks    student: yes, i will incorporate them into my routine, thank you.",3,2
66938,62,"teacher: ok so your last sentence was: 'as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.' what does 'teas' mean here?? ah sorry i get it now ! you mean the verb 'tease' right?  student: i think the meaning here is that fight with other students who are not strong in class.    student: i believe the meaning here is that engaging in physical altercations with weaker students in class.",3,3
66939,62,"teacher: yes ok ok ...maybe 'bully' is a good verb here - do you know that word?  student: no... but i study it now    student: i do not know the word, but i am currently studying it.",3,2
66940,62,"teacher: ok fine...yes so e.g. 'some children bully others.' 'some children are bullies.' (noun for person) some children are bullied at school = passive and finally ....the name of the problem = bullying ....so.....bullying is a serious problem in some schools ok?!  student: yes, so...as a result bullying is a serious problem in some school    student: yes, as a result, bullying is considered a serious problem in certain schools.",3,3
66941,62,"teacher: yes ok good! check for singular/plural mistakes <student> if you can please!!  student: schools!! as a result of, bullying is a serious problem in some schools.    student: as a result of bullying, it is observed that bullying is a serious problem in some schools.",3,2
66942,62,"teacher: ok good wel ldone ok <student> the bit in capital letters needs changing ok? as a result, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, and bullying is a serious problem in some schools. this is a structure you have used before and we need to get this right! if you're not sure of an idea of how to change it tell me and we'll do it together ok?  student: i am not sure...    student: i am uncertain.",3,3
66943,62,teacher: that's ok! hold on... so for example we could use lots of possible phrases to explain the connection between seeing the violence and copying it ok?  student: ok',3,2
66944,62,teacher: one question: if i roll two dice the chances of me getting a double six are _______? any ideas for the adjective? don't worry if not! just tell me... high or low?  student: impossible low    student: impossible low,2,3
66945,62,teacher: ok thanks! so another way of saying this could be: 'it is very _______ that you will get a double six.'? unl_ _ _ _ _ _ '??  student: unl....,3,2
66946,62,teacher: unlikely! so if children play violent video games they are _______ to copy the behaviour they see.' likely or unlikely?  student: wow.. it is very unlikely that you will get a double six sorry.....    student: it is very unlikely that you will get a double sixi apologize for the mistake.,2,3
66947,62,teacher: ok yes good! and the next example? that's ok!  student: likely,1,2
66948,62,"teacher: ok good ...so this is one way you can explain that connection ok? instead of using 'easy'  student: yes,,it become more academic    student: yes, it becomes more academic.",3,3
66949,62,teacher: ok fine....<student> i'll copy the final complete paragraph and we can give it a final review tomorrow ok? thanks for your concentration and hard work today! enjoy your hotel (sorry!)  student: yes..thank you very much.    student: yes..thank you.,3,2

66988,172,"teacher: ah, exciting! ok, i thought we could practise a bit of vocabulary using some ideas from harry potter. in particular, personality adjectives (the adjectives that describe what kind of person someone is) you know how the sorting hat puts students into four different houses at hogwarts? can you remember what kind of students get into gryffindor, harry potter's house?  student: yes. i remenber that.    student: yes, i remember that.",4,2

67004,172,"teacher: if a person is ambitious, they want to achieve goals in life, maybe in their career and they are comfortable with becoming leaders, for example  student: so it's a good word to describe people.    student: so it's a suitable word to describe individuals.",4,2
67005,172,"teacher: yes, i would say so! the noun is 'ambition', what you want to achieve for example, it's your ambition to become a phd student at fudan university, isn't it?  student: yes! it's my ambition.    student: yes, it is my ambition.",3,2

67046,254,"teacher: lovely! since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. 1) some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help 2) others think their ubiquity is annoying even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people 3) i think ads are ok when there's an option to mute or cancel them. in real world it's almost impossible to achieve. thus, i only support ads on the internet  student: i'm terribly sorry to ask for the millionth (?) time but could you possible tell me again the pages and the book's name    student: i apologize for the repeated request, but can you please provide me with the book's name and the specific pages again?",4,3
67047,254,teacher: this was the plan from the last time  student: possibly* did i write this? whoa    student: did i write this?,3,2

67049,254,"teacher: lovely! could you re-read the paragraphs about advertising, please?  student: so i read again. then try to write an essay including my previous sentences ok, sure    student: i have reread the paragraphs about advertising. i will now attempt to write an essay incorporating my previous sentences. okay, i will do it.",3,2
67050,254,"teacher: yes! i think this first sentence could be a good start, what do you think? since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.  student: agree",3,3
67051,254,teacher: feel free to add a couple of sentences for the intro  student: one quick question    student: i have a question.,2,1
67052,254,"teacher: sure  student: what do you think the author means by 'digital advertising' in the second article? digital billboards or internet ads i mean, digital billboards on the streets    student: what is the author referring to as 'digital advertising' in the second article? is it digital billboards or internet ads? specifically, i am referring to digital billboards on the streets.",3,2
67053,254,"teacher: that's a good question, i've been thinking myself! i think they mean digital billboards, because it needs to correlate with the first paragraph and the contrast is, posters in the past vs. digital billboards now or at least it must be!  student: ok. so it probably correlates with the previous artcile article    student: ok. so it likely corresponds with the previous article.",3,2
67054,254,"teacher: yes, it should! two views of the same thing  student: if that's not the case then i would have argued differently. hence the question    student: if that's not the case, then my argument would have been different. that's why i asked the question.",2,3
67055,254,"teacher: so let's stick to the idea of digital billboards aha, i see! how?  student: yes. haha i need to thinl think    student: yes, i need to think.",2,2
67056,254,"teacher: sure!  student: something about that there's no escape from the advertising frenzy, neither online, not offline. and you'll have to become immune at some point and maybe teach your children to do the same, see through things neither ... nor    student: something to consider is that there is an overwhelming amount of advertising, both online and offline. it may be necessary to develop a sense of immunity and teach future generations to do the same, in order to see beyond the surface.",4,4
67057,254,"teacher: yes, i see! your original point was that we have no choice when exposed to billboards, we can't block them like on the internet  student: yes.",3,1
67058,254,"teacher: shall we go at paragraphs one by one, and then you choose which idea you'd like to express? or potentially both  student: that's if we think about digital boards on the streets i'd like to continue expressing the first one so i have to write by hand the whole essay now, right?    student: that is correct. i would like to continue discussing the first idea. should i proceed to write the entire essay by hand now?",3,2
67059,254,"teacher: i think it's a very promising one, easy to write about!  student: yes, much easier.    student: yes, that's correct. it would be easier to continue expressing the first idea. should i proceed with writing the entire essay by hand now?",3,1
67060,254,"teacher: can you type it here, please, sentence by sentence? you've got the first sentence!  student: here? ok!    student: shall i proceed with expressing the first idea about digital boards on the streets? additionally, do i need to write the entire essay by hand now?",3,2

67062,254,teacher: sure!  student: ok. ready to start    student: i will commence in 2 minutes.,2,1
67063,254,"teacher: lovely! since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. the first sentence again  student: it is hard to imagine a single day when you're not bombarded with advertisements, in one way or another.    student: it is difficult to envision a day without being exposed to advertisements in some form or another.",4,3

67065,254,"teacher: right, i'm just thinking... are we still in the introduction part? there's surely more than one way about it, but shall we say for now, 1)a general introduction 2) opinion 1 3) opinion 2 4) your opinion  student: i'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes - even those people have an ad-blocker installed on their pcs. maybe omit 'even those people'?    student: i am certain that even the most devoted supporters of the advertising industry, who view ads as enjoyable, informative, and generally pleasant additions to urban and rural environments, have an ad-blocker installed on their pcs. it is possible to omit the phrase ""even those people.""",4,3
67066,254,"teacher: ok, that's a great sentence, but you are going back to billboards, aren't you?? yes, a comma after landscapes and 'have an ad-blocker...'  student: i'm trying to continue what i wrote last time. or we're doing a new version? so i need more introduction then, right?    student: i am attempting to continue my previous writing. are we proceeding with a new version? do i need to provide more introduction?",3,2
67067,254,"teacher: no, you're right, we're building on the old one! i would say so, and then proceed to the next paragraph that can start with a topic sentence boring, but well-structured! ah, i've got to let you go! shall we continue in two weeks' time?  student: sure. i'll try to maybe write it on my own    student: sure. i will attempt to write it independently.",3,1

67069,254,"teacher: ok, lovely. thursday june 10, same time?  student: that's right!    student: that's correct.",3,1
67070,254,teacher: great! looking forward to it!  student: see you soon!    student: i will be seeing you in the near future.,3,2
67072,52,teacher: hi there...    teacher: hello...,1,0
67073,52,"student: hey, i am here  teacher: ok so, let's have a think about this again <student> ok? don't answer yet but here is what we're going to do: 'i saw this when you_______(teach) us.' so <student>....what action happened first? you seeing the table or me teaching you?    teacher: please consider the following once again, <student>. do not respond yet. the task is as follows 'i observed this when you_______(teach) us.' now, <student>, which event occurred first? was it your observation of the table or my teaching?",3,2
67074,52,student: i seeing table firstly  teacher: are you sure? was i your teacher before that?!    teacher: please reconsider. was i your teacher prior to that occurrence?,2,2
67075,52,student: wow..you teach us first and then gave to us the table chart  teacher: ok good! and was i also your teacher after you saw the table?    teacher: very well! and was i also your teacher after you saw the table?,3,3
67076,52,"student: yes, you are also my teacher.  teacher: ok fine! so we have two actions right? one of them ('seeing the table' ) happened 'inside' the other - the second one existed (me teaching you) existed before, during and after the other so do we use the past simple for both actions?    teacher: ok, so we have two actions. one action happened inside the other. do we use the past simple for both actions?",4,2
67077,52,"student: no,,i think one of them is past perfect  teacher: ah ok i see your idea...well past perfect is some that happened before something else -but this is different because the other thing happened before, during and after ok?    teacher: the past perfect tense is not applicable here because one action occurred before, during, and after the other action.",3,3
67078,52,student: yes  teacher: ok <student> so imagine: i look out of my window and i see a man i have never seen before ok? maybe i ask myself: at the moment...what ________(do)? choose a tense <student> to complete the question!    teacher: ok <student> so imagine i look out of my window and i see a man i have never seen before ok? maybe i ask myself at the moment...what ________(do)? choose a tense <student> to complete the question!,3,2
67079,52,"student: what are you doing? what should i do?  teacher: ok yes good exactly: 'what's he doing? ' and the answer maybe is: 'nothing special ...he ___ just ____ (walk) along the street'    teacher: ok, yes, good. 'what's he doing?' and the answer may be 'nothing special... he is just walking along the street.'",3,3
67080,52,"student: he is just walking along the street.  teacher: ok good thanks hold on so two action right? which one started first? (the seeing or the walking?)    teacher: okay, thank you. so, we have two actions, right? which one started first, the seeing or the walking?",3,2
67081,52,student: walking is the first action  teacher: ok good fine so...we have two tenses: the present simple and the present continuous ok?    teacher: the walking is the first action.,3,3
67082,52,"student: and during he is walking, i saw him, after i seeing him, he still walking along the street.  teacher: yes exactly good! so the seeing is 'inside' the walking!    teacher: yes, that's correct. the seeing is happening while the walking is taking place.",4,3
67083,52,"student: yes,ok  teacher: so...your original sentence was : 'i saw this when you_______(teach) us.' this is in the past it's true but the logic is the same...    teacher: the original sentence was 'i saw this when you _______ (teach) us.' this sentence is in the past, but the logic remains the same.",3,2
67084,52,student: so...i saw the table when you teaching us. because you are my teacher before you give to me the table and during you giving and after you giving to me  teacher: so the first verb is in the past simple good ...and the second needs to be the....?? yes yes that's it!    teacher: so the first verb is in the past simple. and the second verb needs to be in the present simple.,3,3
67085,52,"student: wow..i got it i never understand it before you teaching me this stuff.  teacher: yes that's ok ...so you need the past continuous - how do we make it? we need to two parts remember? the present continuous ____ing and the past continuous?    teacher:yes, that's okay. so you need the past continuous. how do we make it? we need two parts. the present continuous is ""is/are + ____ing"" and the past continuous is...?",3,4
67086,52,"student: was/were + __ing  teacher: ok great so...'i__________ it when you ____ ______ us.'??    teacher: the correct form is the past continuous. how do we make it? we need two parts ""was/were"" + ""___ing"". so, ""i__________ it when you ____ ______ us.""",3,2
67087,52,"student: i saw it the when you were teaching us.  teacher: ok fantastic - you've got it    teacher: the correct answer is ""i saw it when you were teaching us."" well done.",4,3
67088,52,"student: yes!! thanks  teacher: so <student> let's just use this a bit before you forget it! hold on....    teacher: so, <student>, let's just use this a bit before you forget it. hold on...",3,2
67089,52,"student: ok  teacher: so i can say about myself for example: 1. i saw the first lord of the rings film when i was living in spain. 2. yesterday i was driving to the supermarket when i saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. i was going to school when i realized my phone was at home. etc etc ...can you think of a couple of examples (true if possible - but they don't have to be interesting!) for yourself?)    teacher: so <student> let's practice a bit more with the past continuous. here are a few examples for you to consider 1. i saw the first lord of the rings film when i was living in spain. 2. yesterday, i was driving to the supermarket when i saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. i was going to school when i realized my phone was at home. can you think of a couple of examples for yourself? they don't have to be interesting, just true.",3,3

67091,52,student: yes  teacher: ok...,1,1
67092,52,"student: i was learning in cambridge when i visited to london with my friends.  teacher: ok cool - you've got it i think...    teacher: ok, you seem to have grasped it.",2,2
67093,52,"student: yes,,i always need to think which actions is a big in order to confirm the other is inside it.  teacher: yes ok i see - it'll get more automatic over time if you keep practising... <student> - let me give you a couple of examples about how you can use the present perfect or present continuous in ielts essays ok? hold on a sec....    teacher: <student> - let me provide you with a couple of examples regarding the usage of present perfect or present continuous in ielts essays. please wait for a moment....",3,3
67094,52,"student: okey, i still practising this sentence after class.  teacher: ok good    teacher: ok, good.",1,1
67095,52,"student: okey  teacher: by the way ..you vcan save them and copy and paste your examples in our lesson tomorrow if you like ok?    teacher: by the way, you can save your examples and copy and paste them in our lesson tomorrow if you want to.",3,2
67096,52,"student: yes, i like  teacher: hi sorry - internet went out there for a minute ok <student> so let me give you a few typical sentences for essay introductions and we can think about the use of the present perfect/present continuous....hold on remember the problem and solution essay we did in class about the lack of teachers?    teacher: hi, sorry for the interruption. my internet connection was briefly lost. alright, <student>, let me provide you with some typical sentences for essay introductions. we can discuss the usage of the present perfect and present continuous. please wait a moment. do you recall the problem and solution essay we worked on in class regarding the lack of teachers?",3,3
67097,52,"student: yes ,it is always happen...firstly i am unhappy with that.. but i rebased i need to clam down and get a good mood with this problem.  teacher: yes you're right ...count to ten and keep calm....    teacher: indeed, you are correct. it is important to stay calm and composed.",3,2
67098,52,"student: yes, i still remembering the easy of problem and solution.  teacher: ok right...so in the intro maybe we might want to say (for the background sentence) something like: ' the number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' can you put the verb in the right tense?    teacher: alright, moving on. in the introduction, we might want to state (for the background sentence) something like 'the number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' can you provide the verb in the appropriate tense?",3,3
67099,52,student: decline decrease  teacher: so you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! but what tense?? you can copy the verb    teacher: please rewrite the verb 'go down' in the correct tense for the background sentence 'the number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.',3,2
67100,52,"student: declined/decreased/went down  teacher: ok thanks so you;ve chosen the past simple which maybe seems logical but the time phrase 'in recent decades' means up to and including now so....we need the...??    teacher: ok thanks for your response. you have chosen the past simple tense, which may seem logical. however, the time phrase ""in recent decades"" indicates that the action is ongoing up to and including the present. therefore, we need the present perfect tense.",3,3
67101,52,"student: in this intro, do we need the structure of ' it is argued that...' we need the present continuous  teacher: um....not really beacuse the lack of teachers would be given as a fact not an opinion or disagree with you see? to agree or disagree with i mean    teacher: that is not necessary because the lack of teachers is presented as a fact, not an opinion. we are not agreeing or disagreeing with anyone.",2,2
67102,52,"student: okey,i understand  teacher: ok so if i say 'this year' has the time finished?    teacher: if i say 'this year', is the time finished?",3,1
67103,52,"student: if we got the date of this year i think it finished.  teacher: ah well if we say e.g. 24th march 2020 then yes it;s finished but if we only say 'this year' has it finished?    teacher: ah well if we say e.g. 24th march 2020 then yes it's finished but if we only say 'this year' has it finished?   rewritten if we specify a date, such as 24th march 2020, then yes, it has finished. however, if we only mention 'this year', has it finished?",3,2
67104,52,"student: no ,it not finished so we use present simple or present continue  teacher: ok good - so some time phrases automatically need the past simple or the present perfect ok? it depends on the phrase    teacher: alright, so if i mention ""this year,"" has the time period ended?",3,1
67105,52,"student: okey, i understand.  teacher: so e.g. last year/last week/2018/ = ? (past simple or present perfect?)    teacher: so for phrases like last year, last week, and 2018, do we use the past simple or present perfect tense?",3,2
67106,52,"student: present simple because it is specific time  teacher: ok fine (you mean past simple right?!)    teacher: ok, it seems you meant to say ""past simple"" instead of ""present simple"" because it is a specific time.",2,1
67107,52,student: yes  teacher: ok! ok good! and one more...what about 'this morning' ? past simple or present perfect? in real life today!    teacher: ok! ok good! and one more...what about 'this morning' ? past simple or present perfect? _in real life today!_,3,2
67108,52,"student: this morning is...past simple i guess  teacher: yes good!    teacher: yes, that is correct.",3,1
67109,52,"student: because everyday and every time is specific.  teacher: yes that's right - ok so finally: 'in recent decades'? past simple or present perfect? remember the logic of the essay question is : we have a problem now with a lack of teachers.    teacher: ok, let's move on. what about 'in recent decades'? past simple or present perfect? remember the logic of the essay question is we have a problem now with a lack of teachers.",3,3
67110,52,student: let me think past simple!  teacher: ok so remember the result will be either: 'in recent decades the number of teachers has gone down...' or 'in recent decades the number of teachers went down....    teacher: the correct answer is past simple.,3,2
67111,52,"student: because in recent year is present perfect yes..in recent years this problem is big action, now is inside it  teacher: yes good! that keyword is 'recent' which makes us use the present perfect in english because ot means up to and including now you see? not a finished time with less connection to now...    teacher: yes, that's correct. the keyword ""recent"" makes us use the present perfect in english because it means up to and including now, not a finished time with less connection to now.",3,3
67112,52,"student: yes.. i think i can understand it now  teacher: yes i see what you mean about 'inside it' - i guess that;s true - in other words the number of teachers hasn't exactly stopped going down that's right we'll do more tomorrow with more essay intros ok?    teacher:yes, that's correct. we will continue with more essay introductions tomorrow.",3,2
67113,52,"student: yes that is what i like to do  teacher: ok great thanks <student> see you tomorrow...    teacher: okay, great. thank you, <student>. see you tomorrow...",1,1

58298,214,"teacher: yes, you can, of course, say, pay someone. i paid a massage therapist for a massage, for example but efforts / regular face massages pay off or pay off for me  student: i see thank you!    student: i understand. thank you.",3,1

58586,195,"teacher: if you put two things in a straight line, you align them /lan/  student: sorry, it could have been with another student, i can't remember, one sec - maybe i've forgotten the word ) it could be me )    student: sorry, i'm not sure if it was with another student or if i've forgotten the word. give me a moment to check.",2,2
58587,195,"teacher: yoga instructors talk about alignment a lot. for example, your knee should be aligned with your second toe in some poses etc.  student: i see    student: i understand",2,1
58588,195,"teacher: and it can also mean 'agree' the country's leading intellectuals tend to be aligned with the opposition. an example from the dictionary the opposite is misaligned. if the wheels of a car are misaligned, it's not very nice to drive  student: aha! thank you    student: thank you.",2,1
58589,195,"teacher: yes, speaking of children, i feel very lucky that <teacher's child> is so young. he loves the lockdowns and just 'hanging out with mum and dad'. if he was a teenager, it would be a different story!  student: sure i can't imagine what to do with a teenager in the same situation )    student: okay, i understand. i'm not sure how to handle a teenager in a similar situation.",3,2
58590,195,"teacher: i know, it would be crazy! by march, <teacher's child> will have been home 9 months out of 12!  student: wow it's better don't think about )    student: i suggest not dwelling on it.",2,2

58594,195,"teacher: have you got a favourite bookshop? in kyiv or abroad?  student: hm, it's a difficult question we don't have lots of bookshops here in kiev there are lots of online bookshops but it's too expensive to rent a place for a shop here in kyov so usually the boys in 'real' bookshops cost more and peal prefer to buy them online    student: it's hard to find bookshops in kiev. we have more online bookshops than physical ones. renting a shop in kyiv is expensive, so books in physical bookshops are pricier. people prefer to buy books online.",4,3
58595,195,"teacher: ah yes, it's easier for them to operate online then? yes, i see!  student: and bookshops are closing is it right expression? i'm not sure    student: are bookshops closing? is that the correct expression? i am uncertain.",3,2
58596,195,"teacher: that's a shame! and i suppose, if the rent is so expensive, they haven't got any space to put small cafes in bookshops, for example yes, it is the right expression!  student: so it's like vicious circle a vicious circle    student: it's like a vicious circle.",3,3
58597,195,"teacher: yes, another good expression :)  student: i've googled it )    student: i have searched for it using google.",2,2
58598,195,"teacher: books are too expensive, people don't buy them and bookshops go out of business  student: yes!    student: affirmative.",3,2
58599,195,"teacher: do many people read e-books?  student: so we have several chains of bookshops bukva' bookling' booking is more about english language books but i hate the service    student:we have multiple bookshops called bukva' and bookling'. booking focuses on english language books. however, i am not satisfied with their service.",3,3
58600,195,"teacher: and most importantly, there is petrivka :)))  student: they never know what they have in the shop )))    student: they don't know what they have in the shop.",3,2

58603,195,"teacher: yes, i think petrivka is an equivalent of english independent book sellers i don't know the statistics, but i suspect most people in the uk buy books off amazon. it's cheap, convenient and there is an almost unlimited choice.  student: i see    student: i understand",2,1
58604,195,"teacher: then there are big chains like waterstones (i'm sure you've seen waterstones). they are nice, and the big ones have cafes and children departments are fun, children can play and read books there. there is a very nice one in cambridge but just yesterday, i read something disappointing about how staff is treated at waterstones! so we might buy less from them  student: wow, i like it. we need the same here    student: i appreciate it. we require the same here.",3,2
58605,195,"teacher: we buy from blackwells, their online service is very good and they are not amazon! yes, you'd love it! you should visit a big waterstones next time you're in the uk and also, there are small independent bookshops (or small chains). life is hard for them, but they sometimes have amazing books!  student: maybe it's a good idea for business here in kyiv    student: it might be a good idea to start a business here in kyiv.",3,3
58606,195,teacher: sometimes antiquarian maybe!!  student: after the covid era ))    student: during the covid era.,3,2

58615,195,"teacher: a quaint old cottage but quaint is not always positive if you say, 'what a quaint idea!', you don't approve of the idea  student: aha!    student: i understand.",3,2
58616,195,"teacher: it's strange, maybe in an old-fashioned or bad way ok, one more word! tumbleweed it's a plant. when it dies, it breaks off the ground and the wind rolls it around like a ball  student: perekatipole )    student: i don't understand this concept. can you explain it to me?",3,3
58617,195,"teacher: exactly :) also, if you post something on the internet, but there is not response and no likes, it's tumbleweed like this plant rolls around in an empty space, with no people  student: oh, interesting    student: that's interesting.",2,2

58644,249,"teacher: there are words that go with do and words that go with make. sometimes there's .a little bit of. logic, but not always!  student: yes&lt; i know, but i think sometimes i can make some mistakes ..    student: i understand, but i believe i may occasionally make errors.",3,3
58645,249,"teacher: that's it.. i thought it would be a good idea to revise them a little ok, can you think of any nouns that go with 'make'? like make a mistake  student: make a cake .    student: please provide instructions for making a cake.",4,2
58646,249,teacher: yes!  student: i don't know really ..    student: i'm unsure.,2,1
58647,249,"teacher: no worries! in fact, everything to do with food preparation. make a cake, make some coffee, make a cup of tea, make dinner / breakfast / lunch make borshch ..  student: ok . make popcorn.    student: please make popcorn.",3,2

58651,249,"teacher: and then things that i can't classify :. make a promise, make an apology, make a complaint make progress, make a change, make a mistake make a phone call, make a plan, make a mess make friends, make love, make an excuse  student: oh! it's huge numbers of them .0 number    student: there are a lot of numbers.",2,2

58655,249,"teacher: but also metaphorically, he forgot what he was going to say and made a mess of his presentation do you know 'make an excuse'?  student: like ?    student: can you explain how to say ""apologize"" in russian?",3,2
58656,249,"teacher: noo, that's make an apology  student: ah! i see now    student: i understand now.",3,1
58657,249,"teacher: if you make an excuse, you give a reason why you can't do something or haven't done something for example, sorry, i can't come to your party, i need to feed the cat  student: something like that i think    student: find the cause something similar, i believe",3,2
58658,249,"teacher: sometimes the excuse is the real reason and sometimes it's just what people say to get out of a something they don't want to do! hmm, like povod or opravdaniye maybe  student: i see . ! i found the word .    student: i understand. preposition! i discovered the word.",4,3
58659,249,teacher: yeah!! well done you!  student: i just googled it ..    student: i searched for it on google.,3,1
58660,249,teacher: sure i couldn't think of that  student: it's not my .    student: it's not my fault.,2,1
58661,249,"teacher: anyway, some expressions with 'do'!  student: ok! .    student: okay.",2,1
58662,249,"teacher: a lot of things to do with housework to do the housework, do the dishes, do the laundry, do the cleaning, do the gardening but! make beds and make meals .as you remember. then we have things to do with studying  student: ok    student: i understand.",1,2

58664,249,"teacher: and some types of sports as well like do yoga! if you can't play them .like football., you usually do them .like yoga or swimming or weight-lifting. oh, to do a course is another one that goes with studying  student: aha    student: okay",1,1
58665,249,"teacher: ok, and then things to do with work: do some work, do your best, do a job finally, things i can't classify.. do damage, do harm, do somebody good  student: oh now ..    student: now...",2,1
58666,249,"teacher: for example, regular exercises will do you good! not many though..  student: do harm? ah i see    student: is it possible to cause harm? i understand.",2,3
58667,249,"teacher: not exercising will do you a lot of harm! :.. finally, do someone a favour  student: so it could be classified like .    student: it could be classified as consequences for a person.",3,2
58668,249,"teacher: yes, not only for a person though! the storm was terrible but luckily it didn't do any damage to the house  student: sure! i didn't think about it .    student: okay, i didn't consider that.",3,2

59572,118,student: hi <teacher>!  teacher: hi - welcome to the chat how are you? and where are you in the world?    teacher: hello. how are you? where are you located?,2,1
59573,118,"student: thank you! and thank you for letting me improve my english with this study! i am fine, thank you. just a bit cold, it is getting cold here in austria. i am italian, but i moved to graz last year.  teacher: oh austria, interesting! all the pastry and music :)    teacher: austria is interesting. they have pastry and music.",3,2
59574,118,"student: yes, it is a nice place to be :) and you? are you from the uk?  teacher: i'm from ukraine, but i've lived in the uk for the last few years do you speak german as well?    teacher: i am originally from ukraine, but i have been living in the uk for a few years now. can you also speak german?",2,3
59575,118,"student: oh, i see...so you also know what it means to leave your country. even though i suspect you knew the language before reaching the uk. i speak some german, but i am still working on it (the covid lockdown didn't help). i also speak spanish to a decent level.  teacher: yes, i was an english teacher and cambridge examiner back in ukraine. and yes, i know about the whole leaving far from home / making a new country your second home amazing, you're a polyglot! i learned some german at university, but i'm a good few years out of practice and oh so rusty :)    teacher: i used to be an english teacher and cambridge examiner in ukraine. i understand what it's like to live far from home and adapt to a new country. it's impressive that you know multiple languages! i studied german in university, but it's been a while since i've practiced and i'm not very fluent anymore.",3,4
59576,118,"student: sort of polyglot...but i enjoy learning languages. well, you also speak many languages! i believe it is easy to get rusty with german: it is easy to forget about grammar and nouns' genders.  teacher: i don't really count german among them any more. oh my, genders and cases basically broke me! even though there are only three cases in german whereas my native russian has six and ukrainian 7. it didn't help!    teacher: german is difficult because of genders and cases. german has three cases, while russian has six and ukrainian has seven.",3,3
59577,118,"student: as an italian i also have troubles with long words...i really believe english to be a lot easier...  teacher: do nouns have genders in italian? oh yes, german's notorious for its long words, isn't it? yes, i agree, there is a reason english took over the world    teacher: do nouns have genders in italian? german has long words. english became popular worldwide.",3,3
59578,118,"student: yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with german, there are some simple rules to identify a noun's gender. that is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel.  teacher: yes, very similar to russian / ukrainian. basically, does it end in 'a' :)    teacher: yes, it's similar to russian and ukrainian. basically, if it ends in 'a' :)",3,3
59579,118,"student: it is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, i don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin's seeds'  teacher: haha, i see your point!! but i like that german is a bit like lego. once you've learned the most common roots, you can guess the meaning of many words    teacher: i understand your point. german is similar to lego. knowing common roots helps with guessing word meanings.",3,4
59580,118,"student: indeed that is true...and i also find it more 'precise' than italian. don't get me wrong: you can be precise with italian, but in german it is as if the language is ingrained with some rules that force you to be precise.  teacher: hmm, that's an interesting observation. would you say english and german have that in common?    teacher: do english and german have that in common?",3,3
59581,118,"student: while i find english more 'practical' when talking about technical things...both because most technical terms are in english and because it has a somewhat simplified grammar with respect to italian. i would say english is a bit more on the practical side, german on the precision side. but i'd say english is closed to german in this.  teacher: interesting, i've got to think about this one! yes, i suppose as a germanic language it will be a tiny thing: we don't really use possessive 's with inanimate nouns for example, <student>'s book vs. the genders of nounds *nouns, sorry    teacher: yes, germanic language, no possessive 's with inanimate nouns. example: <student>'s book vs. genders of nouns. *nouns, sorry.",2,2
59582,118,"student: indeed i felt weird when typing 'pumpkin's'..  teacher: yes, that's it, you probably know it intuitively! the names of animals count as animate nounds too, e.g. a swan's bill, a squirrel's tail but 'the legs of a table'    teacher: yes, that's correct. animal names are also considered animate nouns, such as a swan's bill or a squirrel's tail. another example is ""the legs of a table.""",4,3
59583,118,"student: unfortunately i like to use language: i have read a lot in english. thank you!  teacher: this is not unfortunate, is it? :)    teacher: is this not unfortunate?",2,1
59584,118,"student: but 'bread with seeds of pumpkin' doesn't sound right...  teacher: oh, and 's is used with time phrases too, as you probably know. this week's newspaper, a month's salary    teacher: 's is also used with time phrases like this week's newspaper and a month's salary.",2,2
59585,118,"student: no, it isn't...but i realise just now how much i know 'intuitively' but i don't really control.  teacher: no, that's because it's 'pumpkin seeds' :)    teacher: no, it's 'pumpkin seeds'.",2,3
59586,118,"student: okay...so a day's work, yes, i know this intuitively  teacher: that's a sign of someone who is bilingual or a native speaker it's only if you learn the language from textbooks that you know the rules    teacher: being bilingual or a native speaker shows that. learning from textbooks only teaches rules.",3,2
59587,118,"student: okay, then i will be extra careful about it ;) even though my guess would be that many english speakers get it wrong too... i agree with you on learning from the textbooks...the problem is that oftentimes, especially here in italy, you study the grammar before you really know how to write a proper sentence.  teacher: back to the bread, you can just go with 'pumpkin seed bread' german-style, but in three words yes, that's how i learnt english, grammar first! i feel that it pays off though if you have a chance to practise a lot afterwards    teacher: for the bread, you can choose 'pumpkin seed bread' german-style, but in three words yes, that's how i learned english, grammar first! it's beneficial if you have a chance to practice a lot afterwards.",3,3
59588,118,"student: easier to pronounce ;) okay...so in general i would put before the noun 'bread' the adjectives, in this case pumpkin seed. or whole flower bread...okay, i got this!  teacher: yes, that would make a compound noun yes, wholewheat flour bread    teacher: yes, that is a compound noun. yes, it is bread made with wholewheat flour.",3,2
59589,118,"student: well, after high school i studied math and now i work with artificial intelligence: so i always used english for 'practical' reasons, but it has been a while since i opened a grammar book.  teacher: or sourdough bread, the lockdown craze in the uk :)    teacher: sourdough bread is popular during the lockdown in the uk.",1,3
59590,118,"student: haha, yes! i wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then i stopped fearing that this is the us american spelling... would that be wrong?  teacher: hmm, let me think. whole milk vs. (semi-)skimmed milk but wholewheat flour we want to stress here that the flour is made out of whole wheat rather than the idea that the flour is whole    teacher: we need to consider the difference between whole milk and (semi-)skimmed milk, as well as the use of wholewheat flour. it's important to emphasize that the flour is made from whole wheat, rather than the misconception that the flour itself is whole.",2,2
59591,118,"student: i am unsure about what 'flour is whole' would mean...  teacher: oh, what i mean is that we use 'wholewheat flour' as opposed to 'whole flour' because, as you say, 'whole flour' does not make sense    teacher:we use 'wholewheat flour' instead of 'whole flour' because 'whole flour' doesn't make sense.",4,1
59592,118,"student: okay, thank you for the clarification!  teacher: no worries. you mentioned that you are interested in punctuation in the sign-up form in the following sentence, a punctuation mark could make it much clearer what you mean i wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then i stopped fearing that this is the us american spelling...    teacher: you mentioned interest in punctuation in the sign-up form. adding a punctuation mark could clarify your meaning in the following sentence. i initially wanted to write 'whole flour bread,' but then i stopped because i was concerned about using us american spelling.",3,2
59593,118,"student: yes, punctuation is one of those things that i have never fully understood. the oxford comma and so on... is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted?  teacher: not really, but when i first read it, i thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the american spelling as in 'you were not afraid anymore' if you put a comma after 'stopped', that would make it much clearer in my opinion    teacher: no, but when i first read it, i thought you stopped being afraid that this was the american spelling. it would be clearer if you put a comma after 'stopped'.",4,3
59594,118,"student: haha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing.  teacher: i wanted to write... but then i stopped, fearing that this is the american spelling does it make sense?    teacher: i considered writing, but i hesitated because i was unsure if this is the american spelling. does it make sense?",3,2
59595,118,"student: indeed! after you wrote about what you understood while reading the sentence i was wondering wether i would put the comma after 'then' or after 'stopped'... would both options be correct?  teacher: if you put a comma after then, this would definitely read like you are not afraid that this is american spelling anymore))    teacher: if you add a comma after ""then,"" it would indicate that you no longer have concerns about american spelling.",3,3
59596,118,"student: yes, indeed...i think this option came to my mind because in italian there is an expression i would have used in this context i.e., 'poi per', which is often followed by the comma.  teacher: i see! i'm thinking of an example i was afraid to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then, i stopped fearing, put my face mask on and went silly example, just ot illustrate the point *to illustrate mind you, your original sentence was good without the comma too, and this is a confusing thing about the english punctuation: very little of it is obligatory or regulated by clear rules    teacher: i thought of an example. i was scared to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then i stopped being scared, put on my face mask, and went. it's a silly example, just to show the point. your original sentence was good without the comma too. english punctuation is confusing because very little of it is required or regulated by clear rules.",3,3
59597,118,"student: i see your point, but a comma would have made the sentence much less ambiguous...  teacher: yes, true! i'd like to recommend an excellent book on the subject. it's called 'eats, shoots and leaves' by lynne truss    teacher: i want to suggest a book called 'eats, shoots and leaves' by lynne truss. it's very good.",4,2
59598,118,student: thank you for the recommendation! i will definitely take a look at it!  teacher: it's a really engaging read and explains some of those punctuation nuances really well the title was inspired by a joke about a panda. do you know this one?    teacher: it's an interesting book that explains punctuation well. the title was inspired by a joke about a panda. do you know this joke?,3,3
59599,118,"student: no, i don't... ...and i don't see how pandas could come into play with that title, to be honest ;)  teacher: well, a panda walks into a cafe, eats a sandwich, then produces a gun, fires two shots in the air and heads towards the exit the waiter asks, 'what was this about?' the panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and shows it to the waiter the entry for 'panda' says, 'panda. large black-and-white mammal, native to china. eats, shoots and leaves.'    teacher: a panda enters a cafe, eats a sandwich, and then takes out a gun. it fires two shots in the air and leaves. the waiter asks why, and the panda shows a wildlife manual with a poorly written entry for pandas. it says pandas eat, shoot, and leave.",3,4
59600,118,"student: haha...this time there was an extra comma! very nice :)  teacher: yes, exactly! the importance of punctuation)) so, what kind of ai are you working on?    teacher: yes, that's correct. punctuation is important. what type of ai are you working on?",4,3
59601,118,"student: currently i am working on a few projects...but the main one, which made me realise that my english knowledge is okay but not excellent, is about gec...that is, you guessed it, grammatical error correction.  teacher: interesting! are there any areas of grammar that you think you would like to improve? your english is excellent, and i'm nit-picking to find something to help you with, to be honest    teacher: do you have any areas of grammar you want to work on? your english is good, but i'm trying to find something to help you with.",4,4
59602,118,"student: well, thank you! i am not sure...as an italian i realise that my language use is a bit peculiar, for example i tend to use a lot of words with latin etymology. if you noticed this, maybe i would like to know some more common alternatives... or there are some sentences which i am not sure if or why they are correct. i guess those could shed some light on some grammatical areas i don't fully control.  teacher: oh i see what you are saying (i haven't noticed). it would be wrong not to take advantage of 60% of the english wordstock. if i recall correctly, this is how much the words of latin origin make up    teacher: i understand now. it would be incorrect to not utilize 60% of the english vocabulary. if i remember correctly, that's how much of the words are derived from latin.",2,3
59603,118,"student: i see, then i will ask you the following: is the sentence 'there are two teachers in class' wrong? i have found something similar in a grammar book, and they suggested 'there are two teachers in the class' as the correct version. do they have different meanings, or is me not seeing what is wrong with the first one?  teacher: ah, articles! yes, you usually need to use 'the' with indications of place    teacher: use 'the' with indications of place.",2,2
59604,118,"student: what i was wondering is if, in this case, 'class' could also mean 'lesson' and so the first one could be correct...  teacher: class' in this sentence is a singular noun, so you need some kind of an article.    teacher: the word ""class"" is a singular noun. you should use an article before it.",2,1
59605,118,"student: as in two teachers are teaching the lesson...but maybe it would be a singular noun anyway...  teacher: i see what you're saying, but class=lesson is also a singular noun and requires an article yes, that's right! and, just like you said right now, you would be more likely to say 'two teachers are teaching a class'    teacher: class=lesson is a singular noun and needs an article. yes, that's correct. you would say 'two teachers are teaching a class' as you just mentioned.",2,2
59606,118,"student: okay, anyway thank you for clearing that up! i didn't realise there are this many rules connect with 'animated objects' or 'indications of place'.  teacher: i've got an idea. maybe you could send me a piece of your writing that you think could be improved prior to the next class? then we could have a more focussed practice next time, looking at the grammar, style and punctuation    teacher: can you send me a piece of your writing that you want to improve before the next class? then we can practice grammar, style, and punctuation.",4,3
59607,118,"student: yes, that is definitely an option. okay! i will sent you two pieces of writing. one written in a speedy manner, one more carefully...  teacher: ok, excellent! would a class at the same time next week suit you?    teacher: would you like to have another class at the same time next week?",4,2
59608,118,"student: i would prefer it to start at 11:00, but if that is not possible 9:30 will be fine :) (oh, i forgot the 'a.m.' there...)  teacher: that's ok, please give me a minute to calculate the time difference is it 11 gmt?    teacher: i will calculate the time difference. is it 11 gmt?",2,2
59609,118,"student: yes which means 14 here (so i can take the lesson after lunch)  teacher: just checking my timetable we should be still on summer time here in the uk, so yes, 11 gmt is good!    teacher: confirming the time for our session. 11 gmt works.",2,2
59610,118,"student: okay. well, let me know if you realise the time changes. perfect! thank you for your time! i am looking forward to the next lesson :)  teacher: no, it should be fine. it just takes me a moment to switch between time zones, with students in different countries my pleasure, have a lovely week, speak to you on tuesday!    teacher: it's okay. it takes me a bit to adjust to different time zones with students in different countries. have a nice week. we'll talk on tuesday.",3,3

59746,64,teacher: oh right i see! but what i meant was: are you happy with the grammar in english of your sentence??!! 'they all wearing full protective equipment.'  student: maybe i need to use present perfect    student: i think i should use the present perfect tense.,3,1
59747,64,teacher: ah ...well if you're talking about right now then the present continuous is ok but have you used it correctly here? this is the same mistake you made before (that's why i'm asking you again!)  student: no..i think i talk about a period of the time.    student: i believe i need to discuss a specific time period.,4,2
59748,64,teacher: ok <student> ...hold on don't worry about changing the tense...it's not the problem here you can use the presnent continuous but you have to make it correctly! with two words remember!!  student: yes!!    student: okay.,2,1
59749,64,teacher: they _____ wearing ...'?  student: they are wearing    student: the students are wearing.,3,2
59750,64,teacher: yes ok good thanks!  student: i think i need to punish myself.    student: i need to discipline myself.,3,3
59751,64,teacher: you could also use present simple here: 'they all wear protective ...' = correct too  student: i always forget it    student: i often forget it.,4,2
59752,64,"teacher: yes don't worry ...it's normal ..not only you! 2 steps forward one step back ..it's normal! <student> let me give you your paragraph from yesterday.... one of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. as a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.  student: yes.. i learn a new word of 'copy' is 'imitate'    student: i learned that the word 'copy' means 'imitate'.",3,3
59753,64,"teacher: yes that's a very good idea! you could definitely use it here this is quite good in many ways...but i wonder: there are 4 sentences here. can you put them in a different order so the paragraph is a bit more logical? you only have to change one sentence (i mean put it in a different place) which one ? 1,2,3, or 4? don't worry if you're not sure...  student: apply 2 to 1    student: please apply the ratio of 2 to 1.",1,2
59754,64,teacher: so hold on..you mean the first sentence should be different? i like that first sentence!!  student: ok..i am not sure    student: i am unsure.,2,1
59755,64,"teacher: no problem...well for me <student> changing round 2 and 3 seems a bit better so...one of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. as a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example. so the 'as a result' directly follows the fact that they can't tell it isn't real do you see?  student: yes.. i see it    student: i understand.",3,3
59756,64,"teacher: ok cool ...  student: it become more logic, 1. topic sentence 2.the explain of main idea 3.consequence    student: it is more logical to structure paragraphs with a topic sentence, followed by an explanation of the main idea, and then the consequence.",4,3
59757,64,"teacher: yes i think so but don't worry too much ..i think your priority <student> is still gettgin the language right ...your understanding of paragraph/essay structure is pretty good i think  student: so..this structure is normal and academic in english writing, right?    student: is this structure typical and formal in english writing?",3,3

59762,64,"teacher: in some countries people prefer renting their homes to buying them. what are the advantages and disadvantages of renting? ok make sense? give me a couple of main ideas just with basic keywords if you like...i'll give you a minute ok?  student: 1. cheaper 2.easy to moving 3.high price can rent a high quality house, but it still cheaper than buy a normal house and disadvantage is following...    student: 1. renting is cheaper. 2. renting is easy to move. 3. renting a high-quality house is more expensive than buying a normal house, but still cheaper overall. there are also disadvantages.",3,2

59764,64,"teacher: ok thanks <student>! can i just check your first disadvantage? the 'furniture' one? what do you mean here?  student: like... tables, beds, refrigerator ......    student: i need information about tables, beds, and refrigerators.",3,1
59765,64,"teacher: ok yes i understand what furniture means! (not a fridge by the way) ...but why can't you buy a large table for example if you;re renting?  student: because when you move to another city or place, it is very unconvenience to move them.    student: it's inconvenient to move things when you change locations.",4,2
59766,64,teacher: ah ok i'm with you! yes of course (just checking though because you'll have to explain this if you use it as a main idea right?) quick question: 'it is very unconvenience ' what kind of word do you need after 'very'? (noun/verb/adjective?  student: adjective i think..    student: i believe it is an adjective.,3,1
59767,64,teacher: ok good yes! can you change your word to an adjective? incon_ _ _ _ _ _ _ '  student: very inconvenience    student: it's very inconvenient.,4,2
59768,64,teacher: hold on <student>....'importance' = adjective or noun?  student: noun because important is an adjective.    student:important is an adjective.,2,3
59769,64,teacher: ok good! can you apply this rule to your two words from just before? so 'inconvenience' = noun/adjective?  student: is a noun    student: a noun,3,2
59770,64,teacher: ok good..and the adjective you need is?  student: inconvenient    student: i apologize for the inconvenience.,2,3
59771,64,"teacher: ok good! so <student> ...getting verb tenses and getting nouns/verb/adjective forms right are two big things you can improve for a better score ok?  student: ok,thanks    student: thank you.",3,1
59772,64,teacher: quick test coming up ok? choose the right option for each sentence : we need silence/silent in the room please. its difficult to tell the difference/different between twins. lung cancer is a common consequence/consequent of smoking.  student: silent/difference/consequence    student: i have a question about the impact of silence and how it can lead to misunderstandings or negative outcomes.,4,3
59773,64,teacher: thanks <student>...you need to change one of your answers! which one?  student: slience    student: silence,1,2
59774,64,teacher: yes ok good! you need 'something' right (a noun in other words) .... you can say need to + verb  student: need to slent silent    student: i need to be silent.,3,3
59775,64,teacher: ah well.....need to + verb so....where's the verb in your last example?? you would need to add one! 'we need to ____ silent now.'??  student: we need to be silent now.    student: please be quiet now.,3,3

64354,20,teacher: ok do ...<student> let's go with the charts! could you write a short sentence with the following information please: australia coal 1980 don't compare with anything else i.e. gas or another time or e.g. france ok?  student: ah i see    student: i understand.,2,1
64355,20,"teacher: ok i'll wait take your time....  student: in 1980, australia had produced electricity by coal source 50 units    student: in 1980, australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal as a source.",3,2
64356,20,"teacher: ok thanks <student> wait a sec... pretty good actually - well done ....so... let's just make a few changes to make it better but a good start i can see you understand the information  student: by natuaral gas 20 units and also the same units by hydro power source    student: in 1980, australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal. additionally, 20 units were produced from natural gas and the same amount from hydro power.",4,3
64357,20,"teacher: si number one : do you need the past perfect? no! what tense? ok ok slow down!  student: ohh sl ohh sorry555    student: oh, sorry for the mistake.",2,1
64358,20,"teacher: thats ok!  student: past sim    student: oh, sorry for the mistake. i meant to say ""past simple.""",3,2
64359,20,teacher: yes good ! so tell me the one-word verb in past  student: produced,3,1
64360,20,"teacher: ok great! is 'was producing' ok?  student: ah i see    student: ah, i understand.",2,1
64361,20,teacher: ......no!  student: ohhh     student: i understand.,4,0
64362,20,teacher: usually you'll just beed past simple = one word ok?! need maybe past perfect but only in certain circumstances...  student: ok,3,1
64363,20,"teacher: so the 50 units refers to electricity...so where does this number phrase go? far away from the noun electricity?  student: coal? sorry, what did you mean    student: coal? i apologize, could you please clarify your previous statement?",3,2
64364,20,teacher: thats ok...so you need to say 50 units of...? units of what?  student: electicity     student: electricity,2,3
64365,20,teacher: yes good! so ...' australia....' try the original sentence again if you can....  student: australia produced 50 units of electricity by coal source in 1980.    student: australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal in 1980.,2,4
64366,20,teacher: ok that's great! one more thing ...hold on... when you say what something is made of/from or where it cones from do you normally say 'from' or 'by'?  student: from,2,3
64367,20,"teacher: yes good...so '50 units of electricity from coal' is enough/perfect! ok?  student: ohh ok but why in the pepper they say by fuel source? paper    student: i see. however, i am curious as to why they use the phrase ""by fuel source"" in the paper.",4,4
64368,20,"teacher: that's just to explain that these materials are sources of fuel but you dont need to repeat that like a title fir the charts you know for  student: oh i see    student: oh, i understand.",3,2
64369,20,teacher: but ok ...lets try a sentence with the word 'source' ...hold on so can you explain exactly tbe same information but this time beginning with the word coal?' take a minute if you need it!  student: let me think 5555ok    student: i need a moment to think.,4,1
64370,20,teacher: no rush....  student: coal was produced to electricity 50 units in australia in1980 .    student: the production of electricity from coal in australia in 1980 amounted to 50 units.,4,3
64371,20,"teacher: ok <student> thanks...hold on... ok so you've got the passive in there...let's tame a step back ....so the first we finished:'australia produced 50 units of electricity from coal'...can you change that into the pasdive? so you need to switch round the subject and object ok? so...begin with the word...? not australia but...?  student: ah electricity was produced    student: electricity was produced from coal in australia, resulting in 50 units in 1980.",3,3
64372,20,teacher: yes good...basically! but how much?  student: ahh 50 units of electricity was produced from coal    student: 50 units of electricity were produced from coal.,1,2
64373,20,teacher: yes great well done!  student: yeh,1,1
64374,20,"teacher: so to get a good score you include different grammar like you've just done and maybe change the...? one word answer? beginning with letter v! the letter  student: v what value?    student: v, what do you mean?",1,2
64375,20,teacher: vocabulary!  student: ah5555 ok thank you    student: i see. okay. thank you.,1,1
64376,20,"teacher: for example the verbs e.g. in this chart you can use 'produce' electronic...can you think of another possinverb sorry...possible verb beginning with g?  student: i though, you want me to change the sentence again555 pls let me think about that    student:i thought you wanted me to change the sentence again. please let me think about that.",3,2
64377,20,"teacher: ah i see sorry yes no problem  student: sorry, did you mean change produce to another word? give?    student: i apologize, did you mean to replace ""produce"" with another word? could ""give"" be a possible alternative?",2,3
64378,20,"teacher: yes ....dont worry...so make electricity is possible but generate is a good one!  student: ah... i forgot this word, thank you    student: i forgot the word. thank you.",3,2
64379,20,"teacher: sometimes if you cant think of another word its ok just repeat one you're co fident with ....your original produce was fine confident  student: ah i see    student: i understand. thank you for reminding me of the word ""generate"".",1,3
64380,20,teacher: ok so another we can change is the number i.e. we can use fractions...so 50 units in this case is...?  student: 50 percents 43862.0    student: 50 percent 43862.0,3,2
64381,20,"teacher: yes either is fine ...but percent without s at the end! one final thing <student> hold on....  student: 5555 ok     student: 5555, understood.",3,1
64382,20,teacher: si another giid thing in ielts is to use words ti describe the meaning of the numbers not just a list of the numbers themselves you see so...hold on... good thing  student: ah,3,2
64383,20,teacher: e.g. ok fine we can say 50 units from coal but what does that mean in the context of the whole chart? it means that 'coal was the...?  student: wood?,3,3
64384,20,teacher: most...?  student: plant log    student: plant log,2,2
64385,20,teacher: no hold on...as a source of electricity coal was the most....  student: oh production    student: the most common source of electricity was coal.,4,3
64386,20,"teacher: ok we're running out of time so...'coal was the most significant source of electricity in australia in 1980, generating 50 units out of 100 units' = a good sentence! ok?  student: ok",4,2
64387,20,"teacher: your noun 'production' is a good word - we'll come back to that next tkme ok? time  student: ok thank you so muck, <teacher>    student: ok, thank you.",3,1
64388,20,"teacher: thanks a lot <student> - some good work today i think i'll speak to you tomorrow ok thanks bye  student: bye, see you    student: bye, see you.",2,1

(i'm going to ask you what you mean to get longer sentences out of you :))  student: slytherin is my favorite house, so i think sorting hat should sort me there) (also i like draco , but it doesn't matter)    student: slytherin is my preferred house, therefore i believe the sorting hat should assign me there. (additionally, i have a fondness for draco, although it is inconsequential.)",3,4
65391,142,"teacher: ah, good sentence, thank you! and very interesting! i'll give you some more words, and you tell me why :) cunning = adjective; clever at getting what you want, sometimes by tricking people like a cunning fox from fairy tales  student: yes i wanted to say it    student: yes, i wanted to say that.",2,2
65392,142,teacher: yes! so why would you like to be in slytherin?  student: we forgot about hufflepuff    student: we neglected to mention hufflepuff.,1,3
65393,142,"teacher: ok, hufflepuff! who is in hufflepuff?  student: i think i am a bit cunning    student: i believe i possess some cunning qualities.",3,3
65394,142,"teacher: what kind of people, i mean ok! cool!  student: friendly",2,2
65395,142,"teacher: yes, friendly and kind!  student: and i like slytherin because everyone think people tgere are a bit scary    student: and i like slytherin because people there are perceived as somewhat intimidating.",2,3
65396,142,"teacher: an adjective that often describes hufflepuff students is 'humble' hm.bl which means not proud or arrogant or believing you're too important he's very humble about his success means he doesn't talk about it very much, for example not many people have this lovely quality :) ok, so why is slytherin your favourite house?  student: i've just type it    student: i have just typed it.",1,2
65397,142,"teacher: oh sorry, i missed that! so everyone is a bit afraid of slytherin people, and you feel it puts them in a powerful position?  student: yes",2,1
65398,142,teacher: ok))  student: like a dark side of hogwarts    student: i find slytherin interesting because people perceive them as intimidating.,3,3
65399,142,"teacher: haha, i see! what do you like about draco then?  student: he is handsome)    student: he possesses an aesthetically pleasing appearance.",3,2
65400,142,"teacher: haha, fair enough! anything else?  student: and he is a boy, who didn't have a choice like harry, but in another way    student: additionally, he is a male individual who lacked the ability to make decisions, similar to harry, albeit in a different manner.",4,3
65401,142,teacher: how do you mean?  student: i am very sprry to him    student: i apologize to him.,1,1
65402,142,"teacher: that's an interesting idea! ah, you're sorry for him but yes, he was conflicted, right? he didn't believe everything his family did was a good thing but he thought he had to be loyal to them ok, i've got a sorting quiz for you! i'm sure you've done them before, but i hope it'll be fun can you open this link?  student: no",2,1
65403,142,teacher: i just re-sent it to you on skype  student: okay,1,2
65404,142,teacher: let me know what you get :)  student: yeah do i have to start it now?    student: do i need to begin the quiz now?,3,3
65405,142,teacher: yes please!  student: ravenclaw:(,1,2
65406,142,"teacher: haha, i thought you'd get ravenclaw, to be honest :)  student: why?",3,3
65407,142,teacher: because you're smart :) i wanted to be a gryffindor! i find courage very important!  student: it is easy to understand what to answer to be at slytherin    student: it is straightforward to comprehend what to respond to be sorted into slytherin,2,2
65408,142,"teacher: but i'm a hufflepuff according to this quiz yes, it's pretty transparent still fun  student: i think you are on hufflepuff too)    student: i think you are in hufflepuff too.",,3
65409,142,"teacher: and, if we were sorted by the real sorting hat, we'd have a chance to influence its decision why am i a hufflepuff? *in hufflepuff  student: you are really kind    student: you are very kind.",3,3
65410,142,"teacher: aww, thank you! and the patron of hufflepuff is helga, a bit like me  student: yes",2,2
65411,142,"teacher: helga is an old form of <teacher's name>, i mean  student: how can we influence ?    student: how can we exert influence?",3,3
65412,142,"teacher: well, you know how the sorting hat wanted to put harry in slytherin? but he wanted to be in gryffindor, and the hat listened to him  student: yes",3,4
65413,142,"teacher: ok, our words for today: brave - bravery; courageous - courage; to dare (verb) - daring  student: but not everybody just can say that i want to be in gryffindor    student: however, not everyone has the ability to simply express their desire to be in gryffindor.",3,2
65414,142,teacher: humble  student: yes,3,0
65415,142,"teacher: yes, that's true! it's only because harry was actually brave, right? any other words?  student: ambitious",3,2
65416,142,"teacher: yes! and cunning ok, i will let you go! have a good afternoon, speak to you on friday!  student: thanks you too bye    student: thanksyou toogoodbye",3,1
65418,74,teacher: hey there <student>...    teacher: hello <student>...,3,1
65419,74,"student: hi <teacher> how are you doing?  teacher: yeah i'm good thanks....still deep into lockdown... how about you?    teacher: yes, i am fine. i am still in lockdown. how about you?",3,2
65420,74,"student: here the same, it seems it'll get till may :(  teacher: yes i see...another few weeks then...last/go on until may    teacher: yes, i understand. it seems that we will continue until may.",3,1
65421,74,"student: i'm alright. a bit stressed at the moment. the online version of the training course is a chaos  teacher: but the light's at the end of the tunnel right?    teacher: the end of the training course is approaching, isn't it?",3,3
65422,74,"student: i don't see much light at the moment to be hones hah honest  teacher: ah right - yes ... doing everything online is ok in theory maybe but in practice... the course is chaotic/a mess/a disaster etc    teacher: ah, i understand. yes, conducting everything online can be challenging in reality. it seems the course is currently disorganized.",1,2
65423,74,student: ok thank you  teacher: is it live on zoom or something?    teacher: is it being conducted through a live video conferencing platform such as zoom?,3,1
65424,74,"student: yes, we meet everyday at 9 on zoom and we are there listening to our teacher until 2pm and after that we have to do a lot of exercises... so a lot of work  teacher: wow..a long time (and mostly the teacher talking?)    teacher: is it a live session on zoom or a similar platform?",3,2
65425,74,"student: far more than when we went to classes  teacher: yes i see - far from ideal    teacher: yes, i understand. it is not an ideal situation.",3,1
65426,74,student: teacher talking and students (we're 20 people) asking or interrupting.... it didn't happen before maybe it's just the beginning and i'll get better (i hope so)  teacher: yes i see- it's tricky to manage the turn-taking - does the teacher use breakout rooms?    teacher: does the teacher utilize breakout rooms for managing turn-taking?,2,2
65427,74,"student: can i ask you a few things i'm not sure about?  teacher: yes sure...    teacher: yes, go ahead and ask your questions.",3,1
65428,74,"student: ohh sorry, i didn't see your question... what are breakout rooms?  teacher: ah ...well i've just realised i think they're only available on the zoom 'pro' account but    teacher: ah... i have come to the realization that breakout rooms are only accessible on the zoom 'pro' account. however,",3,2
65429,74,student: i see... no we don't have pro account  teacher: they allow you to give people (students) time to work together in separate 'rooms' the host can enter each room when they like    teacher: breakout rooms provide an opportunity for individuals to collaborate in separate spaces. the host has the ability to enter each room at their discretion.,3,3
65430,74,"student: i see, that would be great  teacher: yes it's very effective (i was doing lessons on zoom for a bit)    teacher: yes, it is indeed effective. i have experience conducting lessons on zoom.",2,2
65431,74,"student: no, we all work at the same time so well, i'm not sure about the use of 'i' or 'me' in sentences like  teacher: do they use any other functions to allow/control participation? e.g. chatbox/take control of the screen function/whiteboard/screenshare (even?)/ sharing files? sorry go on...    teacher: do they utilize any other functions to facilitate or regulate participation? for example, do they have a chatbox, the ability to take control of the screen, a whiteboard, screenshare, or the option to share files? apologies, please continue.",4,2
65432,74,"student: maria and i went to the park', 'maria and me....', 'she and me...' , 'she and i...' my question is about when we use in these type of sentences 'me' or 'i'?  teacher: ok so ... basically in normal everyday speaking we often say ... me and maria/maria and me = common maria and i' = more careful and some people feel this is the 'correct' way .... in writing you;d usually see thi sform    teacher: in everyday speaking, it is common to say 'me and maria' or 'maria and me'. using 'maria and i' is considered more careful and some people view it as the correct way. in writing, you would usually see this form.",1,3
65433,74,"student: then both are correct?  teacher: in a test or if you want to copy a more careful (pedantic?!) native speaker then e.g. my friend and i = the correct option you will here tens of millions of people say the other way too (including me) so in this sense it is correct too yes    teacher: in a test or if you want to copy a more careful native speaker, you would use ""my friend and i"" as the correct option. however, it is also common to hear people say ""me and my friend"" in everyday speaking. so, in that sense, it is also considered correct.",2,2
65434,74,"student: great, clear now... i thought that one was wrong... i was concern about using it wrongly  teacher: yes i understand ... they are both absolutely correct in the sense of common use ...but yes one is more informal than the other    teacher: yes, i understand. both options are correct in terms of common use. however, one option is more informal than the other.",3,1
65435,74,"student: actually we generally hear 'you and me...' you and i...' sounds weird, doesn't it?  teacher: and some people would never say 'me and my friend...' yes much less common    teacher: and some individuals would never say 'me and my friend...' yes, it is much less common",4,2
65436,74,"student: what about 'you and maria are good friends'? you and she/her are good friends??  teacher: ok hold on...let me clear my head! so you and maria sounds fine you and he are good friends = sounds better than you and him (it;s the nominative form) more correct yes but you will hear people say 'you and him for the subject as in 'you and him can go' but less 'correct''    teacher: okay, let me clarify. ""you and maria"" sounds acceptable. ""you and he"" is better than ""you and him"" because it is the nominative form. however, some people may still use ""you and him"" in the subject, like in ""you and him can go,"" although it is considered less correct.",3,3
65437,74,"student: i see... in spanish it is a very common structure, maybe not so common in english?  teacher: yes i think that's right - that's why even though it seems such a simple phrase it's doesn't come easily to me...    teacher:yes, i think that's correct. it's not as common in english as it is in spanish, which is why even though it seems like a simple phrase, it doesn't come naturally to me.",3,2
65438,74,"student: yes, that's what i thought  teacher: hold on ..give me a quick everyday example sentence (transalated from spanish) if you can...    teacher: please provide a quick everyday example sentence (translated from spanish) if possible.",3,3
65439,74,"student: imaging a situation in a classroom. students have to work in pairs and you say: 'marian and pablo will work together' now the same without their names 'she and he (you pointing at them) will work together??  teacher: yes i see ... aahhhh    teacher: yes, i understand.",1,2
65440,74,"student: or she and him?? maybe you just say 'you two will work together' (pointing at them)  teacher: she and he would be correct yes but just sounds weird because you'd say 'they' !!    teacher: yes, ""she and he"" would be grammatically correct, but it sounds strange because we usually say ""they"" in that context.",2,3
65441,74,"student: i see, so let's forget about it... i was translating from spanish sorry!!!  teacher: no that's ok - it's a fair question...just frustrating somehow and sorry yes...looking back ...exactly yes 'you two' = again the normal way    teacher: no, that's okay. it's a fair question. it's just frustrating somehow. and sorry, looking back, exactly, yes, ""you two"" is the normal way.",3,2
65442,74,student: no frustration! i got it :) and another much easier question!!  teacher: ok...,2,1
65443,74,"student: last day (or the last day??) we talk, when we said good by to each other you said 'have a good one' what does that sentence mean? have a good day?  teacher: the last time we talked/when we talked the other day......and yes...have a good day is the origin i guess..but we kind of use it indiscriminately to mean e.g. weekend or whatever or just see you later alternative! informal but normal for many people sorry i'm using such lazy writing there! (ellipsis etc)    teacher: the last time we talked/when we talked the other day......and yes...have a good day is the origin i guess..but we kind of use it indiscriminately to mean e.g. weekend or whatever or just see you later alternative! informal but normal for many people. sorry, i'm using such lazy writing there! (ellipsis etc)",3,3
65444,74,"student: i see, thanks no worries!!  teacher: yes so many little phrases for hello/goodbye i guess! which ones did you pick up? i was always say 'hasta luego' i think in spanish and never anything else! i don't know if that matters or not really!    teacher: yes, so there are many different phrases for saying hello or goodbye. which ones did you learn? i always say ""hasta luego"" in spanish and nothing else. i'm not sure if that is important or not.",2,2
65445,74,"student: not many i think... for hello just hi or hello and for goodbye see you, bye (never goodbye, i don't know why)  teacher: yes sure well that's fine! 'alright?' is of course very common right?    teacher: yes, that's fine. ""alright?"" is a common greeting, isn't it?",3,3
65446,74,"student: some people say just 'later'?  teacher: um...'later' by itself is only used by some young people i would say....but possible yes (or 'laters' -= another form used by some young people....god this is making me feel old!)    teacher: 'later' is used by some young people, but it is possible. 'laters' is another form used by some young people. this makes me feel old.",3,2
65447,74,"student: haha  teacher: most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see you if you see what i mean)    teacher: the most common phrase is ""seeya"" (pronounced as such, not ""see you"").",3,1
65448,74,"student: and night for goodnight no sorry, i don't understand the explanation of 'seeya'  teacher: yes so your idea about 'goodbye' being unusual is correct - 'bye' by itself = a thousand times more normal ...'goodbye' sounds very final/formal (weird!) so obviiously we say 'see you' and miss out the 'later ' at the end very often ...but many (most!) students pronounce the 'you' with a strong form of the vowel you know?    teacher: yes, your observation about 'goodbye' being uncommon is accurate. 'bye' on its own is much more prevalent. 'goodbye' has a final and formal connotation, which is strange. typically, we say 'see you' and often omit the 'later' at the end. however, many students tend to pronounce the 'you' with an emphasized vowel sound.",3,2
65449,74,"student: yes  teacher: but we use the weak form (the 'schwa' remember?) and it sounds weird otherwise so in writing this is represented as 'ya'    teacher:yes, your understanding of 'goodbye' being uncommon is correct. 'bye' alone is much more common. 'goodbye' sounds very final and formal. we often say 'see you' without adding 'later' at the end. however, many students pronounce the 'you' with a strong vowel sound, but we should use the weak form, represented as 'ya' in writing.",3,2
65450,74,student: yes  teacher: ok,2,1
65451,74,student: question if we change the pronunciation the meaning changes?  teacher: um...no sorry i didn't mean that ...hold on asec..    teacher: um...no sorry i didn't mean that ...wait a second..,2,2
65452,74,"student: ahhh okk ahhh okk  teacher: so non-native don't use weak forms very much it' s true and it basically doesn't matter that much really but we do yes and it can change the meaning but we understand that if you use them/don't use them it's not changing the meaning because you only have one form! you see what i mean?    teacher:so non-native speakers don't use weak forms very often, but it doesn't matter much. we do use them, and it can change the meaning. however, we understand that if you use them or don't use them, it doesn't change the meaning because there is only one form. do you understand what i mean?",3,3
65453,74,"student: yes i see <teacher> : most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see you if you see what i mean)  teacher: ok! it's just taht for some reason the non-native failure to use the weak vowel in the phrase 'see ya' is particularly noticeable ... but it doesn't really matter!    teacher: okay, it's just that for some reason, non-native speakers often fail to use the weak vowel in the phrase 'see ya', and it is particularly noticeable. however, it doesn't really matter.",3,2
65454,74,"student: i got the idea of a different meaning after reading that sentence i copied above  teacher: yes i see what you mean - tricky to talk about pronunciation issues in this format! i do a lot of pronunciation normally in classes    teacher: yes, i understand. it can be difficult to discuss pronunciation issues in this format. i usually cover pronunciation extensively in my classes.",2,3
65455,74,"student: sure, again we miss the audio!  teacher: yes oh well    teacher: yes, i understand your point. it can be difficult to discuss pronunciation issues without audio. normally, i cover a lot of pronunciation in my classes.",0,2
65456,74,"student: then, you suggest that i don't use 'see ya' ??  teacher: oh no - it's fine ! keep using it no problem!    teacher: oh no - it's acceptable! continue using it without any issues.",3,3
65457,74,"student: okkk  teacher: have you noticed people saying alright' for 'hello' a lot?    teacher: have you observed individuals frequently using ""alright"" as a greeting?",2,2
65458,74,"student: no, never ahh yes  teacher: ah interesting! that's what i use very often ...    teacher: ah, that's interesting. i use that phrase frequently.",3,1
65459,74,student: but i thought it meant are you alright?  teacher: ok ..this is very common informally (not everyone uses it ) ah yes i see...it can mean this but it's just become so generuc generic...    teacher: ok ..this is a commonly used informal greeting (not everyone uses it ) ah yes i understand...it can have that meaning but it has become very generic...,3,2
65460,74,"student: ahhh  teacher: so the other person will just reply 'alright' - you see?! it's not a real question but you can answer it a real question if you like!    teacher: so the other person will simply respond 'alright' - do you understand?it is not an actual questionhowever, you have the option to answer it as a genuine question if you prefer.",3,3
65461,74,"student: i don't like it! same in spain... we could say 'qu tal?' instead of 'hola'  teacher: as a real question i mean yes i see...i always found it intimidating when spanish people said e.g. que pasa/que dices ....    teacher: yes, i understand. i always found it intimidating when spanish people said e.g. ""que pasa"" or ""que dices"".",,2
65462,74,student: i don't like it because the person who is saying 'qu tal?' usually is not interested in if you are well or not  teacher: like i had to have some interesting answer yes i see! what about 'cheers' for 'bye' ? have you noticed that much?    teacher: have you noticed that much?,2,3
65463,74,student: haha i don't think they are expecting an interesting answer... i think it's just a different way of saying hello  teacher: ok that's a relief    teacher: understood.,4,2
65464,74,student: in argentina it is worse  teacher: ?,3,1
65465,74,"student: they ask qu haces? what are you doing?  teacher: ok right...yes scary!    teacher: ok right...yes, it can be intimidating.",3,2
65466,74,student: so i use to explain what i was doing and they don't care haha  teacher: :),4,1
65467,74,"student: i used sorry, not anymore  teacher: ok cheers <student> - have a good one and i'll speak to you on thursday ok? see ya....    teacher: ok, <student> - have a good one and i will speak to you on thursday, okay? see you.",3,1
65468,74,"student: yes, thank you very much have a good one you too :)  teacher: no probs    teacher: no problem.",2,1
65470,134,student: hello!,3,0
65471,134,"teacher: hi <student>! how are you?  student: great, thank you! how about you?    student: i am feeling fine, thank you! and how are you?",4,1
65472,134,"teacher: all good, thanks. it's been unseasonally warm here  student: really? here it is quite cold...    student: it is quite cold here.",2,2
65473,134,"teacher: oh interesting! maybe our warmth will soon reach you guys, or maybe vice versa, we'll get your cold weather  student: we shall see...i hope it will get a bit warmer, it really went from summer to winter weather in a matter of days    student: we will observe... i desire for the temperature to increase slightly, as it abruptly transitioned from summer to winter climate within a short period of time.",2,3
65474,134,"teacher: how's the lockdown going for you? are there any aspects you're enjoying or is a survival for you, with two young kids and working from home? i wonder if the climate in austria is less affected by the ocean, with it being landlocked, so you're getting more of a contrast of seasons  student: well...currently it is mostly a curfew, at least the children go to the childminer in the morning. so, currently i am doing fine...i hope they'll let the childminer work, though, because the few hours of silence during the morning make a big difference.    student: well...at the moment, there is mostly a curfew. however, the children are still able to go to the childminer in the morning. so, currently, i am doing fine. i hope they will allow the childminer to continue working because the few hours of silence during the morning have a significant impact.",4,3
65475,134,"teacher: ah, i see! that's good. it's a childminder. someone who minds other people's children, as in looks after them  student: well...yes, austria has a bit more of a continental climate...but graz is relatively close to slovinia and the sea, so it shoud have the best weather.    student: well...yes, austria has a slightly more continental climate...but graz is relatively close to slovenia and the sea, so it should have the most favorable weather.",2,2
65476,134,"teacher: a few hours of quiet, yes  student: at least, this is what they told me. oh! i must have read it wrong the first time: i was wondering about what 'miner' and 'keeping children' had in common... thank you for catching it :) childminder it is, then!    student: at least, that's what i was told. oh! i must have misread it initially i was curious about the connection between ""miner"" and ""keeping children""... thank you for pointing it out ) so, it's childminder then!",2,2
65477,134,"teacher: you sound a bit disappointed in the weather :) i bet it's quite an adjustment for you. it still is for me! yes, no miners! :)  student: haha...well, actually my hometown is quite a rainy place...but in trieste i got used to a very nice weather. how was the week of vacation? i guess the warm weather was a plus for you!    student: how was your week of vacation? i suppose the warm weather was advantageous for you.",3,1
65478,134,"teacher: it rained for most of the week (of course!) but we had a lovely relaxing time, thank you the warm weather has only just started, really did you move to graz for your job / research then?  student: oh...well, then who knows how long it will last... yes, i moved here for my job: it is a very good position...and it is relatively close to my home region: without the corona it takes less about three hours by car    student: yes, i moved to graz for my job. it is a good position and relatively close to my home region. without the corona, it takes about three hours by car.",3,2
65479,134,"teacher: sure. could you fill in the gap: if it wasn't __ corona, it would take less than 3 hours  student: for i think...    student: sure. could you fill in the gap if it wasn't for corona, it would take less than 3 hours.   i think...",3,1
65480,134,"teacher: yes, cool. just checking :) mind you, every time the weather is particularly warm, which i love, there is always a thought at the back of my mind, is it actually the result of climate change and not something to be particularly happy about?  student: i agree with you on that one. climate is more concerned on the weather over time...so a single day of warm could just be okay...    student: i concur with your viewpoint. climate is primarily focused on the weather over an extended period, so a solitary day of warmth might simply be acceptable.",3,4
65481,134,"teacher: yes, but when there is a pattern, there is something to worry about  student: the problem is that it happens so often and that the temperature is so high. indeed...climate change, unfortunately, is a complex problem: everyone should mint it. *mind it...    student: the problem is that it occurs frequently and the temperature is elevated. climate change is a complicated issue that requires attention.",3,3
65482,134,"teacher: yes, well, hopefully, it's not too late to act on this one!  student: i hope it too!    student: i hope so as well.",3,1
65483,134,teacher: it hope __ too  student: that,2,0
65484,134,"teacher: so  student: okay...i agree that 'i hope so too' sounds better, but i wouldn't know why. is it just how the verb 'hope' works?    student:i agree that 'i hope so too' sounds better, but i am unsure of the reason behind it. is it simply how the verb 'hope' functions?",3,3
65485,134,teacher: just thinking how to explain it best  student: (for this particular case)    student: (for this particular case),3,1

65487,134,"teacher: aha, that will be it then, it's language 1 interference for you exactly! and of course, it can be a noun as you know  student: i hope to learn this.' would also be incorrect, right? i mean, 'to learn' would be the direct object in that case    student: 'to hope to learn this' is incorrect, correct? in this instance, 'to learn' would serve as the direct object.",4,2
65488,134,"teacher: oh yes, i hope to do something - perfectly fine no, a direct object would be a noun or something that can function as a noun read a book book - direct object  student: okay...i don't know why i included anything answering to 'what?/who?' under the definition of direct noun.    student: i made an error by including anything that answers 'what?/who?' under the definition of a direct noun.",3,3

65490,134,"teacher: you know what, you're actually right. 'to learn' is an infinitive object now that i think about it in us english, you can say, i'll write you a letter. or she hasn't written me in uk english: she hasn't written to me  student: i'll write to you a letter.    student: i will write a letter to you.",4,3
65491,134,teacher: i'll write a letter to you direct object before the indirect one :)  student: indeed...ordering problem there. about the 'i hope to learn'...so would it be correct to use hope + infinitive object?    student: about the 'i hope to learn'...so is it acceptable to use hope followed by an infinitive object?,3,4

65501,134,"teacher: ok! i'm sure you will soon develop a feel for that ok, the next bit presents a similar challenge. not a parallel structure, but also a grammatical agreement problem i found this book interesting, though being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to read/follow and some concept are, i believe, oversimplified. being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to follow...  student: being packed with ideas makes it sometimes hard to follow. would that be better? even though i don't really like the expression 'being packed with ideas'    student: being packed with ideas sometimes makes it difficult to follow.",3,3

65505,134,"teacher: but if you wanted to keep 'having lost my glasses', it would be something like 'having lost my glasses, i was struggling to read' because i lost my glasses, not 'it' you need the same subject in them  student: i see...so there was not way to simply 'correct' the word 'it'.    student: i understand now. there was no way to simply correct the word 'it'.",1,3
65506,134,"teacher: no, you'd need to re-structure it it's a very common higher-level learner mistake  student: i see...well, it looks rather difficult to find    student: i understand...well, it seems challenging to find.",1,2

65746,9,"teacher: oh ok - so you'd have time to think about returning to the uk...i don't know...once you start eating that real japanese food again...! ok <student>, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible)? my small example = my daughters always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor it drives me mad! (sorry im old!) hes always..ing. .it really drives me mad/crazy .it does my head in (informal). or..you could be one of your parents complaining about you in the past - you decide!  student: sorry, my network is not good today.    student: apologies, but my network is currently experiencing connectivity issues today.",2,0
65747,9,teacher: no problem  student: please send me again.    student: kindly resend the message to me.,3,1
65748,9,"teacher: ok <student>, can you use the structures below to complain about someone you know (tell the truth if possible)? my small example = my daughters always leaving her clothes lying around on the floor it drives me mad! (sorry im old!) hes always..ing. .it really drives me mad/crazy .it does my head in (informal). ok?  student: my sister's wearing my clothes without telling me!!    student: my sister is wearing my clothes without informing me.",3,3
65749,9,teacher: ah ok - is that true?! ok so: my sister's always wearing my clothes without telling me. (you need the 'always' in there too) - and...how does that make you feel?  student: it's okay if she keeps it clean...    student: my sister wears my clothes without informing me. it is acceptable as long as she maintains cleanliness.,2,2
65750,9,teacher: ok right - so you don't mind too much...as long as she keeps them clean! i get it! i forgot you had a sister - what's she doing again?  student: she is starting going university. going to university    student: she is starting to go to university.,2,3
65751,9,teacher: oh right - so she's starting in march/april - that's the start of the academic year in japan right? what's she going to study?  student: from april!! and she is studying nutrition.    student: she will start going to university in april. she will study nutrition.,3,3
65752,9,"teacher: ok right - that sounds like a degree with a job at the end of it! by the way, you'd say: 'she's starting university' (without 'go') hey <student>, going back to the masters idea do you have any idea where you might do it in the uk?  student: i'm thinking about edinborough and bristol    student: i am considering edinborough and bristol.",4,2
65753,9,"teacher: oh right, edinburgh and bristol - both quite cool cities i'd say - have you been to either of them before?  student: no, i've never been there.    student: no, i have not visited either of those places before.",1,1
65754,9,teacher: well like i say both a bit cooler than cambridge! and bigger too - i guess that's partly why...<student> back to complaining - imagine your parents what do you think they would have said to complain about you in the past? (you have to imagine they spoke english for this obviously!). give me an example.the problem and how they felt if you can  student: my parents would say i'm not good at cleaning my room.    student: my parents would complain that i am not proficient in maintaining cleanliness in my room.,3,2
65755,9,teacher: ok right - a common parental complaint! can you try saying that and using the structures from earlier? begin with: he... he's always...  student: he is always making his room messed up    student: he always makes his room messy.,4,2
65756,9,teacher: ok great! yes that's good...so 'he's always leaving his room in a mess' is good and how did they feel about it...?  student: they thought it was because i would have a mental disease.haha    student: they believed it was due to a mental disorder.,3,3
65757,9,"teacher: oh god - i don't know if you're serious! 'they thought i might have a mental illness/be mentally ill' is good - no i think it means you were a perfectly normal teenager right?!  student: yes, at least i think so.haha    student: yes, i believe so.",3,2
65758,9,teacher: i think so! any more complaints from you? about..i don't know...classmates (you don't have to use names!) or people in your accommodation  student: she is always trying to win against me. it was really annoying.    student: she always attempts to outdo me. it is quite bothersome.,3,3
65759,9,"teacher: thanks - 'annoying' = good word here! do you mean like in a game?  student: no, i mean in ielts practices.    student: she consistently attempts to outperform me in ielts practices. it is quite bothersome.",2,3
65760,9,"teacher: ok i see - you mean get a higher score!  student: yes, i do.    student: yes, i do.",1,2
65761,9,teacher: <student> just to practise this quickly can you think of a way (or more than one if possible) :liverpool 1 - barcelona 0 sorry - of describing that score i gave you in a sentence  student: liverpool won against barcelona for 1-0.    student: liverpool emerged victorious over barcelona with a score of 1-0.,4,3
65762,9,teacher: can you delete one word to make it correct?  student: against??,3,1
65763,9,teacher: no try again!  student: for?? for??    student: liverpool won against barcelona _ 1-0.,4,2
65764,9,teacher: yes that's it!  student: i didn't know that.    student: i was not aware of that.,3,1
65765,9,teacher: ok so your sentience is possible/good -can you try another sentence with the word 'beat' for the same score  student: barcelona was beaten by liverpool 1-0.    student: barcelona was defeated by liverpool with a score of 1-0.,4,2
65766,9,"teacher: ok great! or: liverpool beat barcelona 1-0 ('one nil' remember in speaking!) - also we normally say 'were' for a football team in speaking and 'they' you see  student: ah, because they are a team, right??    student: ah, because they are a team, right??   rewritten i understand. is it because they are a team?",3,3
65767,9,"teacher: yes that's it - you can use the singular too though especailly more formally (or imagine like thinking about the club as a company or whatever - definitely in that situation) so <student> - because you're ielts example is not exactly like a knockout competiition you could say she's always trying to beat me (as in my score) but not really win against me - ok?!  student: yes, i mean so. even though ielts isn't a competiton...    student: yes, that is correct.",4,2
65768,9,"teacher: ok - you mean you still want to say 'win' - ok you can, you can - it's possible! to really emphasis she though of it like a compettiion i guess! thought ok <student> - we'll have to stop there - thanks a lot- speak to you soon  student: yeah, i think so.    student: yes, i think so.",3,1
65769,9,teacher: cheers!  student: okay,3,0
65771,28,"student: hi <teacher> still there??    student: hello, <teacher>. are you still available?",3,1
65772,28,"teacher: hi yes i'm here <student> - really sorry for delay...  student: no worries, at the moment i have a lot of free time hehe    student: that's alright. currently, i have a significant amount of free time.",3,2
65773,28,teacher: yes i guess so...is the 'c' word something we should mention or do you want to avoid it completely?!  student: i'm ok with the 'c' word ;)    student: i am fine with the 'c' word.,3,3
65774,28,"teacher: ok well....can i ask - are you allowed to g o out at the moment?  student: how are you in england? i haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you?    student: how are you in england? i haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you?   rewritten how is the situation in england? i am not aware of the latest news, but until yesterday, were you able to lead a regular life?",3,2
65775,28,"teacher: yes more or less - but the current advice is to avoid social contact so things are slowing down fast...many entertainment venues are closing for example it's only a matter of time before more places are forced to shut down i think....  student: we are allowed to go out to the supermarket, pharmacy or to your work place. there is police stopping people and asking where they are going... it's very wired :(    student: we are permitted to leave our homes for essential purposes such as grocery shopping, obtaining medication, or going to work. there are law enforcement officers stationed to inquire about individuals' destinations. the situation feels quite unusual.",3,3
65776,28,"teacher: wow yeah that's pretty heavy - as i say that's definitely on the horizon here sooner rather than later... although weirdly the schools are sti;l open!  student: i don't understand why they keep the schools open having the experiences of italy and now spain there are so many new cases every day... it's scary    student: i don't comprehend the rationale behind keeping schools open despite the experiences of italy and now spain. the number of new cases continues to rise daily, which is disconcerting.",3,3
65777,28,"teacher: yeah i think the rationale is that: stop key workers from having childcare commitments/prevent vulnerable grandparents from being exposed through providing childcare yes i guess that the vast majority of young(ish) people are relatively safe in the event of contracting the illness right...but of course it's very worrying for older people  student: yes, here we had that situation at the beginning when they closed the schools but parents kept working... now most of parents are working from home so they can look after their children and leave grandparents alone    student: yes, here we had a similar situation at the beginning when the schools were closed but parents continued to work. now, most parents are working from home so they can take care of their children and avoid involving grandparents.",3,2
65778,28,"teacher: yes i see...intersting that they expect parents to be able to look after kids and work at the same time! the situation at our school is pretty catastrophic to be honest...perhaps the end!  student: yessss, impossible for a lot of parents... specially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. my nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine?    student: yes, it is impossible for a lot of parents, especially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. my nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine?",3,3
65779,28,teacher: yes - that's a tough change to make for everyone! i'll be in the same boat in a couple of weeks i'm sure... although i'll be effectively unemployed in fact from next week probably  student: ohh really bad the news about your school... i guess there are not students travelling from their countries at the moment?    student: are there currently no students traveling from their countries at the moment?,3,2
65780,28,teacher: yes that's right and the vast majority who were here have left early while they can still get flights i'll have to scratch around getting any online work i can  student: it's going to be very difficult if the situation doesn't change very soon    student: it will be challenging if the situation remains unchanged for an extended period.,4,2
65781,28,"teacher: yes, like lots of businesses the school can't survive more than a few months without income not with the overheads  student: i thought of online teaching, you can always do that. but if people can't work they don't have money to pay online classes... uffff hard    student: i considered the option of online teaching, as it is always a possibility. however, if individuals are unable to work, they may not have the financial means to pay for online classes. it is a difficult situation.",3,3
65782,28,"teacher: so all the staff will probably be laid off yes that's true i guess - that's what everyone's doing but as you say the demand won't necessarily be there right now - we'l see! i'm planning lots of quality time at my allotment...  student: that sounds like a very good plan here you couldn't go to your allotment either!    student: that seems like a reasonable plan. in this location, you are also unable to access your allotment.",3,2
65783,28,"teacher: that's definitely over the top! i think that would never happen in the uk! i've decided that allotments are quintessentially british - i.e. kind of shared/communnal but not really the perfect liberal compromise i mean controlled social spaces you know?  student: sorry, i don't understand what you mean... quintessentially??    student: i apologize, but i am unable to comprehend your statement. could you please explain what you mean by ""quintessentially""? also, i am not familiar with the term ""controlled social spaces"".",1,2
65784,28,teacher: oh right....like the perfect example of seomthing as in allotments are a perfect example of britishness or embody typical british values or whatever  student: ahh i see    student: i understand now.,3,1
65785,28,"teacher: as in they provoke the feeling you should be sociable with your allotment 'neighbours' but there's no demand for you to be 'friends'! you can maintain privacy/distance that's why british people like board games so much e.g. shared activity but with clear rules so that everything's under control! (maybe - just a theory - not an original one)  student: i understand, and i see here there are a lot of places where we could be with people keeping the 2 meters distance that doctors recommend but we can't go anywhere... same in italy haha i like the board games example    student: i understand, and i notice that there are many locations where we could be in the presence of others while maintaining a distance of 2 meters, as recommended by doctors. however, we are unable to go anywhere, which is the same situation in italy. i find the example of board games amusing.",2,3
65786,28,teacher: ok you mean (?) you should be able to go out as long as you stay 2 metres away from people as in: why don't they let us?  student: that is what we have to do when we go to the supermarket or to the pharmacy    student: that is the procedure we must follow when we visit the supermarket or the pharmacy.,4,2
65787,28,"teacher: yes right - that must be strange - especially in spain/italy where you have less personal space - in the uk 2 metres is almost normal anyway! there are lots of jokes in the media at the moment about that sort of thing i.e. it's the perfect excuse for british people to feel less guilty about being...british! i.e. reserved etc  student: but for example, there is a big avenue in front of my house where i could walk without getting too close to people but there is a police officer walking around (not all the time) asking people where they are going... if you go to the supermarket they ask you for the receipt... it's crazy! i go to the supermarket everyday to buy something so that i have some fresh air at list for half an hour    student: there is a large avenue in front of my house where i could walk without getting too close to people. however, there is a police officer occasionally patrolling the area and asking people about their destinations. additionally, when i go to the supermarket, they ask for the receipt. it is quite absurd. i visit the supermarket daily to purchase something, just to have some fresh air for at least thirty minutes.",4,3
65788,28,"teacher: wow - so if you live in a flat (do you?) you basically can't be outside at all really?  student: here there are soooo many jokes about everything... it's great because at least we laugh quite often...    student: there are many jokes circulating here, which is enjoyable as we laugh frequently.",2,1
65789,28,"teacher: yes you've got to laugh or...(you know the ending right?)  student: yes!!! i'm not suppose to leave at all. i'm very lucky, i can see the sea from my sofa and i live alone but i'm very sorry for families who live in a small flat with little children noooo, i don't know the ending! please, tell me...    student: i am not supposed to leave my house. i am fortunate enough to have a view of the sea from my sofa and i live alone. however, i feel sorry for families who reside in cramped apartments with young children. i am not aware of the ending. please enlighten me.",3,3
65790,28,"teacher: ..or you'd cry! not really funny or clever - just wondered if you knew! often we don't bother saying the second part like lots of idioms... yes really tough as you say for people with toddlers etc i live in the middle of nowhere so i guess nobody can stop me from going for a walk where i am....  student: haha we have something similar! 'me ro por no llorar'    student: noooo, i am not aware of the ending. please enlighten me.",2,2
65791,28,teacher: ok nice - thanks! exactly the same really...  student: you are very lucky there in the middle of nowhere    student: you are fortunate to be in a remote location.,3,1
65792,28,"teacher: ya gotta laugh' is if you can imagine the quick spoken form of the phrase... hey <student> do you read phonemic script by the way? as in you'd follow this right?: /jg(t)lf/  student: what is being very nice is that there are a lot of free stuff available online, specially on instagram. there are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, yoga classes... everything to keep us doing something!! i have a diary to be able to remember all the activities i'd like to do ;) sorry, i go back to your question    student: what is nice is that there are many free resources available online, particularly on instagram. there are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, and yoga classes. it provides opportunities for engagement. i have a diary to keep track of the activities i want to do.",3,3
65793,28,"teacher: yes that's great - i guess we're luck to have the internet these days in this situation ...ok i'll wait..  student: i don't know all the symbols but i recognise a lot of them every time i check a word in the dictionary (very often) i have a look at the phonemic script    student: i am not familiar with all the symbols, but i am able to recognize many of them. whenever i consult a word in the dictionary (which happens frequently), i take a look at the phonemic script.",2,2
65794,28,"teacher: ok i understand - well, can be useful i think - once you get used to it it's very quick - that's great you check in the dictionary  student: wait, do you check words in the dictionary?? or look up?    student: do you check words in the dictionary? or do you look them up?",3,1
65795,28,"teacher: the more i teach the more i focus on pronunciation to b ehonest you can say check or look up - both fine (and common) i guess 'chec' could imply you kinda know a bit already and 'look up' can suggest you know nothing you see? check' i mean a new phrasal verb by the way used by young people (but not by me) = 'search up' as in: i'll search it up on my phone' - sounds horrible to me but lots of kids are saying that now!  student: i think it's very important (pronunciation). i always check it when i have doubts because it's been difficult for me to make people understand me sometimes when i lived in england... since i spend some time there the first time i went, i realised how important it is to know the correct pronunciation of words... i won't use search up then ;)    student: i believe pronunciation is highly important. i always refer to the dictionary when i have uncertainties because it has been challenging for me to communicate effectively in england. during my initial visit, i recognized the significance of knowing the accurate pronunciation of words. consequently, i will refrain from using the term ""search up.""",3,3
65796,28,"teacher: yes i think that's great you focused on that - i remember the small amount of time i heard you speaking you seemd to have very good pronunciation (especailly for a spanish speaker - sorry that sounds like a back-handed compliment)  student: ohh thank you! i try hard :) what does back-handed compliment mean??    student: i appreciate the compliment. i put in a lot of effort. could you please explain the meaning of ""back-handed compliment""?",3,2
65797,28,teacher: um...a compliment that could be understood as an insult  student: hahah,,1
65798,28,teacher: as in your pronuncation is good but only compared with other spanish speakers who are generally terrible (and no i don't mean that entirely) ..but many spaniards do need to focus more on pronunciation of course!  student: i understand what you mean now    student: i comprehend your explanation now.,1,2
65799,28,"teacher: it can be very frustrating if you don't do it fairly early on..  student: i think it's our teachers fault (teachers here). they don't care too much about it, here grammar seems to be veryyy important    student: i believe it is the fault of our teachers. they do not prioritize it, as grammar seems to be of utmost importance here.",1,3
65800,28,"teacher: yes i'm sure you're right - i guess it'll change with the exposure to authentic speech on the internet etc it's definitely changed already in my expereince the average pronunciation of my younger students is better than 10 years ago for example cos they watch netflix all the time... or youtube or whatever  student: yes, that's terrible. every time i try to record a whatsapp message in english my phone doens't get a word :(. when i do it in spanish it works perfectly...    student: yes, that's unfortunate. whenever i attempt to record a whatsapp message in english, my phone fails to capture any of the words. however, when i record messages in spanish, it functions perfectly fine.",4,2
65801,28,teacher: oh really? its not because it's on the 'spanish' setting is it? i'm sure you 're good enough to get a device to understand you no?  student: do you know what i am talking about? when you speak and your phone writes what you say...    student: do you understand the concept i am referring to? when you verbally communicate and your phone transcribes your speech...,3,2
65802,28,"teacher: yes yes i know  student: nooo, in english, i change the language when i want to do it in english    student: when i speak in english, my phone's speech-to-text feature does not accurately transcribe my words. however, when i switch the language setting to spanish, it functions perfectly fine.",3,3
65803,28,"teacher: hey <student> did you notice my spanish intefernce just not - seriously, when i put 'no' at the end of my sentence - that's not normal - it something i retained from speaking spanish years ago... cos it's more efficient  student: haha no, i haven't realised until now that you said it. it's true that 'no' it's much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc    student: yes, i haven't noticed until now that you said it. it's true that 'no' is much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc.",3,2
65804,28,teacher: yes you know that in 50 years linguists predict that we will all say just 'innit?' in english (which currently is associated with lower class speakers) i say it for 'isn't it?' which is a little bit lower class (!) but some poeple say it for all question tags (which is definitely more frowned upon by snobs)  student: i'd be very happy to take that lower class speakers habit!! ;)    student: i would be content to adopt the habit of lower class speakers.,3,3
65805,28,"teacher: yes you'll be fine in 50 years! ok <student> i guess that's an hour more or less right? i'm really sorry again about the delay today - i'll speak to you tomorrow at 13:15!  student: it feels very artificial for me to use the question tags, when i use them i feel very posh haha yes, thank you very much! see you tomorrow :)    student: it feels unnatural for me to use question tags. when i use them, i feel sophisticated. thank you. see you tomorrow.",2,2
65807,205,"student: hi, <teacher>!    student: hello, <teacher>.",3,0
65808,205,"teacher: morning! how are you?  student: fine, thank you    student: i am doing well, thank you.",3,1
65809,205,"teacher: one second, i'll go upstairs  student: quite a busy day for friday ) how are you?    student: how are you?   rewritten how are you?",3,2
65810,205,"teacher: what have you got on today?  student: our chat, than yoga, than i have to work with some school staff, then i'll go to the face massage and then a lesson    student: our chat, followed by yoga, followed by working with school staff, followed by a face massage, and finally a lesson.",3,3
65811,205,"teacher: yes, nice and busy!  student: than i have to finish watching a vebinar about some marketing staff    student: then i have to finish watching a webinar about some marketing staff.",2,2
65812,205,"teacher: do you mean the people who work for the school or some work you need to do for the school? the school staff ah, now i see! it's stuff. some marketing stuff and staff = people who work in the company a staff meeting; staff room  student: because they have limited access till 22/02 and i'm not sure that i'll have enough time on the weekend ah! sure! so in both sentences i meant stuff    student: because they have limited access until 22/02 and i am uncertain if i will have sufficient time during the weekend.",2,3
65813,205,"teacher: they are pronounced quite differently too, i would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff yes, i got you) sounds interesting, the webinar on marketing!  student: i would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff - i'll do it! ok it's about lovemarks )    student: i will listen to the pronunciation in the dictionary to differentiate between ""stuff"" and ""staff"". i understand now. the webinar on marketing is interesting.",2,3
65814,205,teacher: lovemarks??  student: the brands which love their clients    student: the brands that have affection for their clients.,3,2
65815,205,teacher: interesting!  student: maybe do you know the girl who founded here in ukraine a big chain of places where you can rent the wardrobe    student: perhaps you are familiar with the woman who established a large network of locations in ukraine where one can rent clothing.,3,3
65816,205,"teacher: oh, where you can hire some clothes? i remember vaguely, something starting with o...  student: then she founded other services too: beauty, photo services, the shops with some nice stuff ) yes! to hire some clothes ) the name is oh my look )    student: then she established additional services as well, such as beauty and photo services, and shops offering various items. yes, it is for the purpose of renting clothes. the name of the establishment is oh my look.",1,3
65817,205,teacher: yes! i remember now!  student: so now she has a big international chain of beauty bars    student: so now she has a large international chain of beauty bars,3,2
65818,205,"teacher: well done her!  student: actually i know her from our teenage ) but we have not communicated till that times )    student: i am acquainted with her from our teenage years, although we did not communicate until that time.",3,3
65819,205,"teacher: you haven't communicated ___ those times  student: now she decided to do an online intensive course about lovemark and then she will do a big 2,5 month course about brand you haven't communicated from those times    student: now she has decided to enroll in an online intensive course about lovemark and subsequently pursue a 2.5-month course on branding. you have not communicated since that time.",3,2
65820,205,teacher: since!)) or 'since that time'  student: oh! since! since that time! of course!    student: you haven't communicated since that time.,3,1
65821,205,"teacher: wow, she's really branched out i've looked it up, apparently, lovemarks are supposed to replace the idea of brands. i've never heard about this stuff!  student: branched out? ) it means that she has lots of branches of her business?    student: it means that she has many branches of her business?",2,3
65822,205,"teacher: branch out = good business word; to start to do something different from what you usually do for example, if you now opened an alma bakery for students to go to after classes, that would be branching out yes, it comes from the idea of branches of a business  student: i see the webinar was about two weeks ago and i didn't watch the third part when i had access    student: the webinar was two weeks ago and i didn't watch the third part when i had access.",4,2
65823,205,"teacher: oh, i see, you need to do it while <student's child>'s with her nanny, makes sense!  student: and now they prolongated access so i have to watch it    student: and now they extended the access, so i am required to watch it.",3,3
65824,205,teacher: nice!  student: how can i say ?    student: how can i express the idea of having enough time to watch something?,4,2
65825,205,"teacher: ok, have you had a chance to watch the video about a nursery?  student: exactly ?    student: exactly, how can i say ?",3,1

65836,205,"teacher: gender is something that can be reinforced through toys. as in, behaviour associated with men / women can be reinforced through toys but i don't think it can work with 'prevent from'  student: gender behaviour, characteristics and roles societies associate with men or women they have it after the video    student: gender behaviour, characteristics and roles societies associate with men or women they have it after the video",3,1

65849,205,"teacher: i actually think, in terms of gender stereotypes, it would do more for children if they saw grown-ups in different 'non-traditional' roles. for example, if they had a male teacher at the nursery (but i bet they don't)  student: i even 'didn't recognize' them )\ yes! i bet you know the theory that they learn not from our words but from our behavior    student: i did not recognize them. yes, it is likely that you are aware of the theory that children learn from our actions rather than our words.",3,2
