    Hello <STUDENT>! STUDENT:
    Hi <TEACHER>!",,0.999087465
22314,"TEACHER:
    Hi - welcome to the chat
    How are you? And where are you in the world? STUDENT:
    Thank you! And thank you for letting me improve my English with this study!
    I am fine, thank you. Just a bit cold, it is getting cold here in Austria.
    I am Italian, but I moved to Graz last year.",0.998000399,0.938766082
22315,"TEACHER:
    Oh Austria, interesting!
    All the pastry and music :) STUDENT:
    Yes, it is a nice place to be :) And you? Are you from the UK?",0.986824436,0.627084832
22316,"TEACHER:
    I'm from Ukraine, but I've lived in the UK for the last few years
    Do you speak German as well? STUDENT:
    Oh, I see...so you also know what it means to leave your country. Even though I suspect you knew the language before reaching the Uk.
    I speak some German, but I am still working on it (the covid lockdown didn't help). I also speak Spanish to a decent level.",0.997536516,0.996570983
22317,"TEACHER:
    Yes, I was an English teacher and Cambridge examiner back in Ukraine. And yes, I know about the whole leaving far from home / making a new country your second home
    Amazing, you're a polyglot!
    I learned some German at university, but I'm a good few years out of practice and oh so rusty :) STUDENT:
    Sort of polyglot...but I enjoy learning languages. Well, you also speak many languages!
    I believe it is easy to get rusty with German: it is easy to forget about grammar and nouns' genders.",0.991618495,0.999184088
22318,"TEACHER:
    I don't really count German among them any more. Oh my, genders and cases basically broke me!
    Even though there are only three cases in German whereas my native Russian has six and Ukrainian 7. It didn't help! STUDENT:
    As an Italian I also have troubles with long words...I really believe English to be a lot easier...",0.994620759,0.893270873
22319,"TEACHER:
    Do nouns have genders in Italian?
    Oh yes, German's notorious for its long words, isn't it?
    Yes, I agree, there is a reason English took over the world STUDENT:
    Yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with German, there are some simple rules to identify a noun's gender. That is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel.",0.998812817,0.999162717
22320,"TEACHER:
    Yes, very similar to Russian / Ukrainian. Basically, does it end in 'a' :) STUDENT:
    It is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, I don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin's seeds'",0.874278215,0.24682751
22321,"TEACHER:
    Haha, I see your point!!
    But I like that German is a bit like Lego. Once you've learned the most common roots, you can guess the meaning of many words STUDENT:
    Indeed that is true...and I also find it more 'precise' than Italian. Don't get me wrong: you can be precise with Italian, but in German it is as if the language is ingrained with some rules that force you to be precise.",0.929362146,0.985416656
22322,"TEACHER:
    Hmm, that's an interesting observation. Would you say English and German have that in common? STUDENT:
    While I find English more 'practical' when talking about technical things...both because most technical terms are in English and because it has a somewhat simplified grammar with respect to Italian.
    I would say English is a bit more on the practical side, German on the precision side. But I'd say English is closed to German in this.",0.995912189,0.997608407
22323,"TEACHER:
    Interesting, I've got to think about this one!
    Yes, I suppose as a Germanic language it will be
    A tiny thing: we don't really use possessive 's with inanimate nouns
    For example, <STUDENT>'s book vs. the genders of nounds
    *nouns, sorry STUDENT:
    Indeed I felt weird when typing 'pumpkin's'..",0.968224181,0.530994621
22324,"TEACHER:
    Yes, that's it, you probably know it intuitively!
    The names of animals count as animate nounds too, e.g. a swan's bill, a squirrel's tail
    but 'the legs of a table' STUDENT:
    Unfortunately I like to use language: I have read a lot in English. Thank you!",0.672625169,0.882140803
22325,"TEACHER:
    This is not unfortunate, is it? :) STUDENT:
    but 'bread with seeds of pumpkin' doesn't sound right...",0.333196342,0.642768422
22326,"TEACHER:
    Oh, and 's is used with time phrases too, as you probably know. this week's newspaper, a month's salary STUDENT:
    No, it isn't...but I realise just now how much I know 'intuitively' but I don't really control.",0.351348909,0.410838544
22327,"TEACHER:
    No, that's because it's 'pumpkin seeds' :) STUDENT:
    okay...so a day's work, yes, I know this intuitively",0.096416761,0.550348563
22328,"TEACHER:
    That's a sign of someone who is bilingual or a native speaker
    It's only if you learn the language from textbooks that you know the rules STUDENT:
    Okay, then I will be extra careful about it ;) Even though my guess would be that many English speakers get it wrong too...
    I agree with you on learning from the textbooks...the problem is that oftentimes, especially here in Italy, you study the grammar before you really know how to write a proper sentence.",0.593251341,0.999093773
22329,"TEACHER:
    Back to the bread, you can just go with 'pumpkin seed bread'
    German-style, but in three words
    Yes, that's how I learnt English, grammar first! I feel that it pays off though if you have a chance to practise a lot afterwards STUDENT:
    Easier to pronounce ;) okay...so in general I would put before the noun 'bread' the adjectives, in this case pumpkin seed.
    Or whole flower bread...okay, I got this!",0.990011475,0.998959632
22330,"TEACHER:
    Yes, that would make a compound noun
    Yes, wholewheat flour bread STUDENT:
    Well, after high school I studied math and now I work with artificial intelligence: so I always used English for 'practical' reasons, but it has been a while since I opened a grammar book.",0.998259567,0.163320087
22331,"TEACHER:
    Or sourdough bread, the lockdown craze in the UK :) STUDENT:
    haha, yes! I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the US American spelling...
    would that be wrong?",0.071975392,0.995639361
22332,"TEACHER:
    Hmm, let me think.
    Whole milk vs. (semi-)skimmed milk
    but wholewheat flour
    We want to stress here that the flour is made out of whole wheat
    rather than the idea that the flour is whole STUDENT:
    I am unsure about what 'flour is whole' would mean...",0.998047244,0.999075255
22333,"TEACHER:
    Oh, what I mean is that we use 'wholewheat flour' as opposed to 'whole flour'
    because, as you say, 'whole flour' does not make sense STUDENT:
    okay, thank you for the clarification!",0.999482873,0.727492554
22334,"TEACHER:
    No worries. You mentioned that you are interested in punctuation in the sign-up form
    In the following sentence, a punctuation mark could make it much clearer what you mean
    I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the US American spelling... STUDENT:
    Yes, punctuation is one of those things that I have never fully understood. The Oxford comma and so on...
    Is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted?",0.491766372,0.998600377
22335,"TEACHER:
    Not really, but when I first read it, I thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the American spelling
    as in 'you were not afraid anymore'
    If you put a comma after 'stopped', that would make it much clearer in my opinion STUDENT:
    haha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing.",0.997142535,0.996574079
22336,"TEACHER:
    I wanted to write... but then I stopped, fearing that this is the American spelling
    Does it make sense? STUDENT:
    Indeed! After you wrote about what you understood while reading the sentence I was wondering wether I would put the comma after 'then' or after 'stopped'...
    Would both options be correct?",0.953542682,0.996182275
22337,"TEACHER:
    If you put a comma after then, this would definitely read like you are not afraid that this is American spelling anymore)) STUDENT:
    Yes, indeed...I think this option came to my mind because in Italian there is an expression I would have used in this context i.e., 'poi però', which is often followed by the comma.",0.999489455,0.996855315
22338,"TEACHER:
    I see! I'm thinking of an example
    I was afraid to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then, I stopped fearing, put my face mask on and went
    Silly example, just ot illustrate the point
    *to illustrate
    Mind you, your original sentence was good without the comma too, and this is a confusing thing about the English punctuation: very little of it is obligatory or regulated by clear rules STUDENT:
    I see your point, but a comma would have made the sentence much less ambiguous...",0.993140352,0.997445226
22339,"TEACHER:
    Yes, true!
    I'd like to recommend an excellent book on the subject. It's called 'Eats, shoots and leaves' by Lynne Truss STUDENT:
    Thank you for the recommendation! I will definitely take a look at it!",0.475449752,0.986004706
22340,"TEACHER:
    It's a really engaging read and explains some of those punctuation nuances really well
    The title was inspired by a joke about a panda. Do you know this one? STUDENT:
    No, I don't...
    ...and I don't see how pandas could come into play with that title, to be honest ;)",0.564658896,0.998529009
22341,"TEACHER:
    Well, a panda walks into a cafe, eats a sandwich, then produces a gun, fires two shots in the air and heads towards the exit
    The waiter asks, 'What was this about?'
    The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and shows it to the waiter
    The entry for 'panda' says, 'Panda. Large black-and-white mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.' STUDENT:
    Haha...this time there was an extra comma! Very nice :)",0.995697189,0.510806619
22342,"TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly! The importance of punctuation))
    So, what kind of AI are you working on? STUDENT:
    Currently I am working on a few projects...but the main one, which made me realise that my English knowledge is okay but not excellent, is about GEC...that is, you guessed it, Grammatical Error Correction.",0.169789975,0.961522757
22343,"TEACHER:
    Interesting! Are there any areas of grammar that you think you would like to improve?
    Your English is excellent, and I'm nit-picking to find something to help you with, to be honest STUDENT:
    Well, thank you! I am not sure...as an Italian I realise that my language use is a bit peculiar, for example I tend to use a lot of words with latin etymology. If you noticed this, maybe I would like to know some more common alternatives...
    Or there are some sentences which I am not sure if or why they are correct. I guess those could shed some light on some grammatical areas I don't fully control.",0.992423028,0.990478504
22344,"TEACHER:
    Oh I see what you are saying (I haven't noticed). It would be wrong not to take advantage of 60% of the English wordstock. If I recall correctly, this is how much the words of Latin origin make up STUDENT:
    I see, then I will ask you the following:
    Is the sentence 'There are two teachers in class' wrong? I have found something similar in a grammar book, and they suggested 'There are two teachers in the class' as the correct version.
    Do they have different meanings, or is me not seeing what is wrong with the first one?",0.986007402,0.869132794
22345,"TEACHER:
    Ah, articles! Yes, you usually need to use 'the' with indications of place STUDENT:
    What I was wondering is if, in this case, 'class' could also mean 'lesson' and so the first one could be correct...",0.890166411,0.664051869
22346,"TEACHER:
    Class' in this sentence is a singular noun, so you need some kind of an article. STUDENT:
    As in two teachers are teaching the lesson...but maybe it would be a singular noun anyway...",0.9953234,0.999452723
22347,"TEACHER:
    I see what you're saying, but class=lesson is also a singular noun and requires an article
    Yes, that's right!
    And, just like you said right now, you would be more likely to say 'two teachers are teaching a class' STUDENT:
    Okay, anyway thank you for clearing that up! I didn't realise there are this many rules connect with 'animated objects' or 'indications of place'.",0.999508752,0.744212497
22348,"TEACHER:
    I've got an idea. Maybe you could send me a piece of your writing that you think could be improved prior to the next class? Then we could have a more focussed practice next time, looking at the grammar, style and punctuation STUDENT:
    Yes, that is definitely an option. Okay! I will sent you two pieces of writing. One written in a speedy manner, one more carefully...",0.475251988,0.986426683
22349,"TEACHER:
    Ok, excellent! Would a class at the same time next week suit you? STUDENT:
    I would prefer it to start at 11:00, but if that is not possible 9:30 will be fine :)
    (oh, I forgot the 'a.m.' there...)",0.76797655,0.939868118
22350,"TEACHER:
    that's ok, please give me a minute to calculate the time difference
    is it 11 GMT? STUDENT:
    yes
    which means 14 here (so I can take the lesson after lunch)",0.943922747,0.280111253
22351,"TEACHER:
    Just checking my timetable
    We should be still on summer time here in the UK, so yes, 11 GMT is good! STUDENT:
    Okay. Well, let me know if you realise the time changes. Perfect!
    Thank you for your time! I am looking forward to the next lesson :)",0.710296765,0.975223544
22352,"TEACHER:
    No, it should be fine. It just takes me a moment to switch between time zones, with students in different countries
    My pleasure, have a lovely week, speak to you on Tuesday! STUDENT:
    You too, bye!",0.969549194,0.979863854

    Today is the second day of my new cycle quarantine.
    I suppose I'm used to living in isolation, because my schedule is like the previous 14 days. TEACHER:
    Yes I guess you must be used to it by now! Is there anything different about where you are now compared to before?",0.964954774,0.583104527
22356,"STUDENT:
    no!! maybe it is just living in different hotels.
    But sometimes I really want to go for a run. TEACHER:
    Right I see...yes I'd really like to go for a run too. I normally run a lot but I have a knee injury at the moment. Ironically, I'd be stuck inside anyway even without this virus!
    So you just have to stay in a room all day?
    How do you get your meals?",0.999162796,0.97662715

    but they all different. yes!!! they all wearing full protective equipment.

22361,"STUDENT:
    yes....I was happy with that, because I can far away from my parents...haha TEACHER:
    Oh right I see! But what I meant was: are you happy with the grammar in English of your sentence??!! 'they all wearing full protective equipment.'",0.733376925,0.872327129
22362,"STUDENT:
    maybe I need to use present perfect TEACHER:
    Ah ...well if you're talking about right now then the present continuous is OK but have you used it correctly here?
    THis is the same mistake you made before (that's why I'm asking you again!)",0.93400819,0.413502851

    no..I think I talk about a period of the time. TEACHER:
    OK <STUDENT> ...hold on

    I always forget it TEACHER:
    Yes don't worry ...it's normal ..not only you! 2 steps forward one step back ..it's normal!
    <STUDENT> let me give you your paragraph from yesterday....
    One of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. Because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. As a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.",0.9191997,0.55655712

    yes.. I learn a new word of 'copy' is 'imitate' TEACHER:
    Yes that's a very good idea! You could definitely use it here
    This is quite good in many ways...but I wonder: there are 4 sentences here. Can you put them in a different order so the paragraph is a bit more logical? You only have to change one sentence (I mean put it in a different place) Which one ?
    1,2,3, or 4?

    yes,that is perfect",0.999460664,0.245794693

    All good, thanks!
    Have you had the time to do the reading part?",0.917081884,0.929775942

    I had time to do the first exercise and part of the second one...

    Ok, sure!
    Absolutely! How did you find the tasks?",0.888148846,0.998807914
35686,"STUDENT:
    Well, I was expecting to solve them in less time, but you really need to read through them...
    I see that there are many sentences and expressions that aren't very common...I would say I managed to do a decent job anyway, but I guess I can ask you about a few expressions ;.
    Anyway given the right amount of time I think they are not too hard :. TEACHER:
    Yes, they are deep-reading rather than scanning exercises. Having said that, once you know how the task works and know what you're looking for, the process speeds up considerably .and we'll work on those techniquies.",0.952108897,0.799902412

    I believe part 5 can be tricky...anway, I can copy paste the answers for that one, and some expressions I found difficult if you want TEACHER:

35689,"STUDENT:
    To begin, I don't know the meaning of the expression: 'this was something of a plum', but I guess it means something along the lines 'this was a positive thing' .referred to her age..

    Oh, a plum job is a good one, a job worth having",0.862733127,0.632198903
35690,"STUDENT:
    As the others are true but only because we have 'an outside view', while she doesn't know TEACHER:
    Aha, I see what you're saying. A plum doesn't mean an advantage here!

    Because she refuses to call it luck...and tries to find explanations not involving luck but some of her qualities .even the age. TEACHER:
    Could you find a phrase in the text that means 'because she deserved it'? It's that penultimate paragraph that starts with ''Later,'",0.965663496,0.950173289
35692,"STUDENT:
    She must have got the job on her merits' TEACHER:
    Yes, absolutely!
    There is 'evidence' for each correct answer in the text. If a candidate is taking a paper-based version of the test, it might be useful to underline it

    Which ones have you done?",,0.816378037

    37. D, 38. H , 39. A...but to be honest I am sure only about the first one
    This is really a time-dependent task, and I didn't manage to read everything properly TEACHER:
    Ok, great. Actually, with this task, you're looking for links between paragraphs. The text really is very big, but there are distinct links that can help to complete the task without reading everyting in-depth
    The first two are correct, let's try to find those links
    One second
    Why is the first one D?",0.984613685,0.941501571
35704,"STUDENT:
    .I also think this is easier to do on paper as you can cross sentences you used and visually see what is remaning. TEACHER:
    Yes, definitely. But I think, if you happen to take the computer-based version of the test, you can drag-and-drop paragraphs, which is quite helpful visually",0.987819426,0.756920517
35705,"STUDENT:
    Hmm...now that I am reading it I am not sure anymore
    I think it was the beginning: 'In times gone by, all seven islands...' and then the stories goes on
    in the paragraph 'Sometime in the last century, the last of the trees on high ground were' TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly. The first paragraph: how Spanish sailors found the Canaries .flourishing agriculture.. Paragraph 2 .D.: deforestation begins Paragraph 3: the last of the trees are cut down
    Also, .D. gives us the name of the island. In the first paragraph, it's just 'the Canaries', and in paragraph 3 they are talking about 'the north of the island', so we're supposed to know which island it is
    Something that D fills in for us",0.993884653,0.735686371
35706,"STUDENT:
    could 39. be F, since it talks about fog not touching the ground...and then there is a paragraph about fog harvesting? But I still have a problem with the previous paragraph talking about Chile.. TEACHER:
    One sec, I'll look at 39
    Yes, correct! Riebold explains why saplings died without fog harvesting
    By the way, to go back to 38, there is such a good link there. The next paragraph starts with 'these failed efforts', so you know that 38 needs to be the description of the failed efforts",0.998898652,0.823097519
35707,"STUDENT:
    Oh, I didn't notice...but yes, I should have noticed that... TEACHER:

    Would you like to have a go at 40?",0.413919295,0.4985697

    40 B since the previous paragraph tells about the first project starting
    And in B you have some results of these first trials .2 liters collected, when 1 was enough. TEACHER:
    Yes, and also the following paragraph says 'having declared the initial project a success' .so we need a success story for 40.
    Correct",0.986621188,0.449474916
35709,"STUDENT:
    .when 1 would have been enough...? Are both these expression okay?. TEACHER:
    1 would have been enough .but they had two, so it's a conditional.

    I don't know...there is a line about irrigation which could be linked to farmers .and thus G. TEACHER:
    Ok, let's leave 41 for now. What about 42? There's a very clear link in the first sentence of the following paragraph",0.32544762,0.241508944
35712,"STUDENT:
    42 A
    the paragraph ends talking about a bigger project covering 50 square kilometers
    and A starts talking about a more ambitious scheme TEACHER:
    But the knock-on effect of reviving the forest goes beyond restoring wildlife'
    Which means that the paragraph should talk about... restoring wildlife",0.830249628,0.996780083

    Oh, in that case it's E TEACHER:
    Yes, correct!",0.823205693,0.664083157
35714,"STUDENT:
    then 43 is G, I guess, since the next paragraph begins with 'Whether or not fog harvesting will prompt a large- scale return to agriculture' TEACHER:
    I see what you're saying about 'this more ambitious scheme' with A, actually, but it doesn't work with the following paragraph
    Absolutely, we finally get to the farmers in 43
    So you've now used D, H, F, B, E and G
    The options for 41 are A and C",0.99737444,0.771468411
35715,"STUDENT:
    I guess C
    I guess it's C...but why...mm
    I don't see clear links to be honest TEACHER:
    No, there aren't. C is suddenly a story about the past, doesn't really work here
    I've got to let you go, it's obviously A byt he process of elimination. If you have a minute to see why later on, that could be part of the homework, together with the last task if you have the time",0.960267222,0.954376019

    Do you recommend that forums to learn English?
    Those, sorry",0.608125575,0.912884822

    Well I think taht for a more advanced learner they are, as i say, a really rich source of spoken-style language
    they contain a huge amount of authentic idiomatic language for esample

    It sounds very good

    could you mention the ones you know?",0.981509795,0.874143166
35724,"TEACHER:
    But it's great because for example you get one youtube video and hundreds of comments and they all naturally use a whole range of language to describe the same thing you know? It's like a mini-corpus!

    yes, thanking everyone for not organising barbecues in the park",0.309387568,0.87402574
35730,"TEACHER:
    OK! So you get the idea....he gets more personal later, thanking individual nurses etc (ironically they're immigrants!)

    Yes I know, I saw him on the Spanish news talking about his hero 'a Portuguese nurse'",0.701985668,0.998909851

    here are the first 5 .... my quick overall question first is: Which one supports Boris?
    1. Maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - I'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. It was only ever going to go one way lol 3. I’m so glad you’re ok Mr Johnson. I shouted “YES!” when I heard you were discharged from hospital. You’re the best prime minister we have had. Caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. Truly admirable. Please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! You deserve it. 4. You actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. I hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious NHS and other public services. 5. What a load of bollocks, knew he’d recover straight away STUDENT:
    haha a variety of opinions",,0.801553544
35733,"TEACHER:

    And quite similar to real speaking a lot of it.... STUDENT:

    I didn't konw you could use the word 'bugger' to call a person",0.921976452,0.733068973
35734,"TEACHER:
    OK so as you can imagine most of the people posting comments are critical! Only one is unequivocally pro-Boris right? Yes...a bugger! A little bit old-fashioned perhaps (and not that rude any more)
    OK <STUDENT> so a few language questions for you if you're ready... STUDENT:
    ahh good! I thought it was an expression, something like 'shit!'
    yes, I'm ready!",0.998656438,0.947205225

    Yes, you;re right ... it;s that too like if you;re hurt yourself/forget something for example (bit less rude than shit) STUDENT:
    I see",0.584875405,0.517543439

    Can you find a word/phrase in the 5 comments with the following meaning? They’re in the right order by the way):   a) get better/not die! b) allowed to leave hospital  c) generous d) unpleasant and prolonged experience  e) brief contact with something unpleasant f) rubbish

    YEs sure....it;s the use rather than the basic meaning which gets harder as you get more advanced of course... STUDENT:

    is common STUDENT:
    okk",0.956277689,0.546531694

    yes I guessed 24 would be tough - it's ;outcry' - have you seen that before? STUDENT:
    no, never",,0.962667449

    it's like protest/controversy/opposition

    bit Germanic I guess! STUDENT:
    I understan, thanks",0.684269253,0.643380775

    I'm sure...",0.775417175,0.894338861

    as in some will be in your passive knowledge but perhaps not used so much

    Can you give an example? I can't think of any",0.85288253,0.618793995

    pass
    overtake
    ? not sure",0.916369701,0.638111964
35802,"TEACHER:
    Ah well possible I guess - as in the moment itself - but more generally we can say 'outrun'
    by the way overtake good idea and very common (but still only for the moment itself) STUDENT:
    Another new word for me!!",0.996013195,0.748270168
35803,"TEACHER:
    lots of Spanish speakers just say pass - good to have thought of overtake = very natural
    but yes 'outrun' = normal too so good to know
    What about e.g. score more points than? STUDENT:
    no idea",0.68719016,0.599453786

    yes!
    be more than (in number) STUDENT:
    but I don't know how to use these words!!
    For example, can I say 'My team outscored more points than yours'?",,0.932429083
35806,"TEACHER:
    Well for example....if Mnachester UNIted beat Barcelona 5-0 then the sports report might say that they outfought, outran, outmuscled, outscored, outplayed Barcelona
    any combination of these verbs!
    and others too! STUDENT:
    i see",0.991932653,0.640738443
35807,"TEACHER:
    bit more formal than some phrases but still you'll hear these words a fair bit STUDENT:
    So the example I wrote is not correct, is it?",0.661251029,0.569946445
35808,"TEACHER:
    by the way 'outnumber' was the last one - this is really common...as in e.g. males outnumber females in senior managemnt roles (or whatever!)
    sorry  - which example are you saying wasn't correct? STUDENT:
    I'll try to correct it... My team outscored yours last night
    Before your examples, I wrote one",0.777657747,0.942150692
35809,"TEACHER:
    Oh sorry I see it now!
    Yes you just need to say 'outscore' because this already includes the idea of 'points'
    this is why it's quite efficent you see!
    German! STUDENT:
    Now I got it... I think
    haha yes",0.994871008,0.75123786

    I actually don't know, maybe it's the right way to stop the virus but it's very hard for everyone...",0.995285256,0.149482017
35812,"TEACHER:
    yes - it'll be very difficult I'm sure - maybe people will start rebelling after a while I don;t know
    You know it's weird in the uK because we have no history of the state really being able to tell us what to do do you see? STUDENT:
    About your daughter and children in general, I know it's really hard but then I think of children who live in Siria for example where they can leave their houses because there are bombs and I think that we are lucky...",0.968491206,0.930949168
35813,"TEACHER:
    so e.g. the realtionship with the police is kind of contractual
    No of course you're right...it's all relative!
    I should take my own advice and change my perspective! STUDENT:
    No, I think it's very normal... we are all confused and we all have contradictory ideas about everything at the moment... It's a very new situation but I think it'll take longer enough (unfortunately) to clarify our ideas

    But we can say 'it was lucky that the eyeshadow I wanted was in stock'
    or 'it was unlucky that the advent calendar was out of stock'",0.990995793,0.838815518

    can I use All I like to buy is new clothes, for example? TEACHER:

    A very quick look at your writing from the last time! You were well prepared for the question about no grammar :)
    Dear <TEACHER>, thank you for your question. We completely understand you, so we need to make you sure that our teaching method is about communication - it's communicative method All our teachers use it for making students communicate easily. On our lesson you will speak a lot and to learn some words and expressions which are really very useful in your usual life here in Ukraine At the same time you will learn some grammar basics and letters, but we are sure that it will be fun because of our method of teaching and our experienced teachers",0.703144116,0.6396874
35868,"STUDENT:
    Aha TEACHER:
    I have a bit of a problem with 'we need to make sure' It sounds like it's something you've decided you need to do in the future rather than something you're already offering your clients",,0.616808921
35869,"STUDENT:
    Ah TEACHER:
    I would suggest 'let me assure you'",,0.430114001
35870,"STUDENT:
    Should I use different expression?
    assure?
    Ah, I see TEACHER:
    Let me assure you that our teaching method is all about communication",0.591440224,0.961125368

    Make someone sure TEACHER:

    Yes!",0.693119156,0.795533583
35872,"STUDENT:
    so need is more about future?
    Because in Russian it's ok to use it
    to use it in this case TEACHER:
    Well, if I say, I need to buy an advent calendar, it's nearly December",0.633108586,0.618193992

    Clear! Thank you TEACHER:
    it's Present Simple, but I'm talking about something I'm planning to do

35874,"STUDENT:
    aha, I see TEACHER:
    Then I would change 'make students communicate' to 'help students communicate'",0.831557387,0.648247355

    sure
    agree
    it's better TEACHER:

    HEy there - sorrry give me a minute - go to relight my fire... STUDENT:
    sure",0.989456027,0.949909366

    OK  the kindling has caught this time...
    I sit warm where you are at the moment?
    is it warm i mean! STUDENT:
    Sorry, I don't understand... kindling??",,0.981431637
35883,"TEACHER:
    Ah yes sorry - it's the name for the little bits of wood or whatever you use to start the fire at the beginning STUDENT:
    Here 18 degrees now, during the day it's very sunny",0.828575502,0.100156961

    NIce....yes it's actually really sunny this week here too - and maybe....13 degrees! STUDENT:
    Not too bad 13!!",0.99889525,0.97985092
35885,"TEACHER:
    yes! Actually my boat gets warm in the sun so it doesn't really matter about the outside temperatrue...
    Have you heard of the Amazon 'Kindle' the thing for reading ebooks STUDENT:
    That's good! I always imagined that boats were cold, so I was wrong
    Yes, I know what a Kindle is! I prefer books but I see how convenient a Kindle can be...",0.179673771,0.999437642
35886,"TEACHER:
    Well they can be in a way - they're kind of a cross between a car and a house you know? As in they don't retain heat very well but hey warm up quickly STUDENT:
    I see",0.968076331,0.535734309
35887,"TEACHER:
    Yes I just mentioned it because it struck me that it's related to the idea of kindling you see? BEcause you kindle a flame - in this cae the flame of knowledge... you kindle a feeling
    in this case STUDENT:
    ahh interesting...",0.640354816,0.735764574
35888,"TEACHER:
    it's related to 'candle' by the way as you can imagine
    So <STUDENT>...inversion.... STUDENT:
    now I know but before you explained I didn't! thanks
    yes, inversion!!",0.875653878,0.997945436
35889,"TEACHER:
    OK....so we use it for with a limited number of phrases/words - basically negative adverbs - to make something limited or emphatic....
    for example....the word never (a limiting word let's say...) hold on
    I have never seen such a terrible sight = Never have i seen such a ...you see? STUDENT:
    I have a question about something you wrote yesterday. In the sentence 'Not only do I like chocolate I also like cake', do we need to write 'do'??",0.492882324,0.155708017
35890,"TEACHER:
    yes we do! Hold on.... STUDENT:
    I understand the example with never",0.9602118,0.409324418
35891,"TEACHER:
    OK that's good/...
    With the present simple v, and past simple verbs we need  auxiliary verb do/did
    and also make the main verb the infinitive ...
    for example....hold on
    Not only does he love chocolate...
    i.e. he + love NOT loves STUDENT:
    ok
    I didn't know we need auxiliary in affirmative sentences",0.829076159,0.991119236
35892,"TEACHER:
    One last example: He only realised later that ... = only later did her realise that...
    Yes not normally - but inversion is a special case STUDENT:
    I see",0.80085339,0.795109068
35893,"TEACHER:
    although <STUDENT> you know of course that we sometimes say e.g. I do like chocolate right? STUDENT:
    Yes, I know that... but it is different, isn't it??",0.792073654,0.687555978
35894,"TEACHER:
    in fact I Could have written: you know that we do sometimes say I do like... STUDENT:
    In I do like chocolate I can remove 'do' but in inversion we can't (if I understood well)",0.422082233,0.959514386
35895,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's true of course.. STUDENT:
    okk",0.732881734,0.867860208
35896,"TEACHER:
    I guess it's a bit similar in the sense that it's related to emphasis STUDENT:
    I see",,0.630132146
35897,"TEACHER:
    Sorry I can't resist: I Could have written e.g. You do know that we do sometimes say I do like chocolate? STUDENT:
    do do do do do do haha",0.688492118,0.19269344
35898,"TEACHER:
    3 extra do's in one sentence STUDENT:
    From now I'll use 'do' all the time",0.878438134,0.932542325
35899,"TEACHER:
    yes - and actually not really exaggerated - we might really say that and it wouldn't sound strange
    Go for it! Seriously, it's much more common than we think... STUDENT:
    same with did??",0.252231077,0.194951553
35900,"TEACHER:
    It's not always accompanied by a big dramatic tone/gesture/statment STUDENT:
    I mean, is it also common??",0.272650437,0.736420798
35901,"TEACHER:
    yes the same in the past
    and common STUDENT:
    Ok",0.99760741,0.824980287
35902,"TEACHER:
    For example we often just use it to draw attention to something
    not in a big dramatic way
    for example...I did want to go out later (actually) STUDENT:
    I see",,0.73816706
35903,"TEACHER:
    just a gentle way of suggesting that even though maybe it's late/we're busy or whatever (not always stated) i still wan tto go out
    Some of the phrases we invert by the way are pretty formal but not all
    Formal ones = for example: scarcely/seldom/little
    more normal: not only/only then STUDENT:
    Are these the adverbs that go at the beginning??",0.751248191,0.734634588
35904,"TEACHER:
    yes exactly..so e.g. Seldom have I been so impressed by blah blah
    e.g. Little did he think that he would meet him again
    I think <STUDENT> if you listen to more formal speaking (or read stuff like that) you'll notice it more know STUDENT:
    I'll pay more attention from now...",0.739568661,0.851504665
35905,"TEACHER:
    notice it more now' I mean  - now that your attention has been drawn to it STUDENT:
    yes, I knew what you meant",0.931666077,0.8259186
35906,"TEACHER:
    Yeah - it's interesting - because it's one of those 'grammar' things that doesn;t really change the meaning so you can basically not notice it and it doesn't really matter
    i.e. that's why people don't notice it STUDENT:
    I'm surprised but I don't remember studying that at all... maybe I did and I've forgotten about it",0.75189856,0.577369952
35907,"TEACHER:
    Maybe you were away that lesson! It is something that's often covered quite quickly and in a self-contained kind of way STUDENT:
    Maybe...
    Just to clarify...",0.956950782,0.896172374
35908,"TEACHER:
    Ah - did you see my auxiliary there? I did that one without thinking (e.g. It IS something that's covered...)
    yes go ahead
    you'd hear the difference in speaking (i.e. emphatic) easily STUDENT:
    If the inverted sentence (do you call them like this) is in past simple we use DID and if it is in present simple we use DO",0.789608657,0.845422483
35909,"TEACHER:
    Yes and yes ('inverted' =correct and do/did for present/past respectively) STUDENT:
    And...",0.998487081,0.807410796
35910,"TEACHER:
    yep... STUDENT:
    if it's in present simple you don't use auxiliary but you invert the order (have he...)
    but for present or past simple you don't invert the order (did he think...)
    sorry, I meant present perfect simple when I wrote the example (have he...)",,
35911,"TEACHER:
    Ah right i see hold on... STUDENT:
    Am I right?? I deduced that from your examples but no idea...",0.674958083,0.233986774
35912,"TEACHER:
    well, in the present perfect the auxiliary is 'have' right? so, e.g. Not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied blah blah SAME idea in the present = Not only does he steal from me he...OK?
    Nice verb 'deduced' by the way! STUDENT:
    I see!! have is the auxiliary...",0.956192879,0.997546009
35913,"TEACHER:
    yes  that's it STUDENT:
    deduce: deducir en español ;)",0.839699768,0.820456046
35914,"TEACHER:
    yeah i Guess that's an easy one then! IS it formal in Spanish? STUDENT:
    It's not really formal, we use it a lot...",0.915520238,0.999240762
35915,"TEACHER:
    Oh right - it's a bit formal in English
    educated' or whatever STUDENT:
    and do you have an informal word for that?",0.997231921,0.992731976
35916,"TEACHER:
    some people might never say it I guess... STUDENT:
    maybe 'guess'?",0.802457807,0.975945619
35917,"TEACHER:
    um ..well i guess like lots of these things it would be replaced by a phrasal verb often - so e.g. work out
    or guess of vourse yes
    but 'work out' is maybe best here
    i just mean more common STUDENT:
    ok, thanks
    Could we practise the inverted sentences a bit?",0.981758077,0.891562719
35918,"TEACHER:
    because it's like a little process you know? 'Guess' i soften just a quick little or one-step  thing
    yes sure - i'll give you a prompt OK? UNless you have an idea of your own first? STUDENT:
    Sure, I see the difference between guess and work out. I sometimes struggle to use phrasal verbs because I don't know where to write the thing I worked out...
    Maybe we could talk about that another day, sorry (mixing topics)",0.908509811,0.699047432
35919,"TEACHER:
    yes! well most are 'separable' so e.g. work out something OR work something out = both correct STUDENT:
    About a prompt, yes please
    Ahhh, I thought there was a rule about it!!",0.968660508,0.544425112
35920,"TEACHER:
    ok so e.g.: I haven't had so much fun since I was in Spain.
    Can you invert that? STUDENT:
    Little fun have I had since I was in Spain??",0.737160426,0.999316782
35921,"TEACHER:
    Yes I see your idea...Start with 'Not since...' STUDENT:
    It's difficult!!!",0.960363561,0.597216404
35922,"TEACHER:
    so it's the 3-word negative bit you've got to ivert
    invert imean
    e.g. i haven;t had
    Not since I was... STUDENT:
    Not since I was in Spain haven't I had so much fun
    Not sure!",0.703919196,0.996282825
35923,"TEACHER:
    yes good! You've already got the negative with 'not' at the beginning though so: 'haven't I had'? STUDENT:
    Not since I was in Spain have I had so much fun??",0.577872254,0.849840433
35924,"TEACHER:
    yes exactly ...you made your first little baby inversion.... STUDENT:
    ufff very hard... I get very stressed when I see hard new things... OMG there are so many things to learn about a language...
    Thank you very much for your time and your patience!",0.081229936,0.692933212
35925,"TEACHER:

35930,"STUDENT:
    Yes, non-essential business are closed, and there are limitations for bars and restaurants...
    I find it okay, but it is though sometimes with the children screaming all around me (I have two small children, of 2 years and ten months...) TEACHER:
    I see! It's stricter in the UK in this case as I think bars and restaurants have to shut unless they deliver food",0.998421807,0.999485113

    And it is also good for them: this way they can learn German... TEACHER:
    Oh wonderful, so it's just her children and yours then? Here too, childminders have a limit on how many children they can look after and they are 'competitively priced', that is they are usually no more expensive than a nursery/ pre-school and you can use your funded hours towards fees",0.960399009,0.231798056

    For now yes...actually her children go to school so in the morning they currently are alone, but a new child might come. Actually, there was an attempt but the child's mother was too protective: a child of almost two years who wouldn't eat anything solid, not even a banana...
    Here they are a bit more expensive than nursery, but we couldn't get into nursery because my wife is unenployed (she received just now the recognition of her degree to work here as a nurse).
    And there is some priority list: so we were excluded because of the number limit which, I believe, was reduced also because of Covid. TEACHER:
    So if a parent isn't working, the family might be refused a place at a nursery? But that's a vicious circle, they will never be able to start work then!

    Oh, yes
    Indeed, there is some kind of a priority list, that would be okay.
    What I wrote was more of a word-by-word translation from Italian... TEACHER:
    You can say colloquially, 'There's some list somewhere' or something like that, so it's not terribly wrong, just you seem to stick to quite formal English, and it stood out for me

    I should use 'some kind of' when I don't know an exact description, right? Like there is some kind of regulation you must follow...
    Yes! TEACHER:

    Great - how was your Christmas - did you stay in Cambridge? STUDENT:
    No, we went to Mallorca Island... It was very warm and sunny!
    How was your trip to the lake district?",0.972911317,0.991465919

    Oh right yes - I remember now you said  you were going away! What did you think of Mallorca? STUDENT:
    There were beautiful beaches and I felt really relaxed as few people were there.",0.997008395,0.920376577

    right that sounds lovely I spent a few years living in Spain and I do miss it sometimes! STUDENT:
    Oh really! Was it for your work?",0.956480188,0.576615817

    well yes basically - I just taught in different schools STUDENT:
    Then you must miss sunshine during winter.",0.66110939,0.159683885

    Yeah I do miss the sun! <STUDENT>: 'few people' = formal or normal? STUDENT:
    I thought it's normal... but formal?",0.999165014,0.999470133
36057,"TEACHER:
    A bit yes....can you tell me the thing you said about MAllorca in a different way?
    the thing about few people i mean STUDENT:
    Not many people were there...
    But it sounds different.",0.855443849,0.979516182
36058,"TEACHER:
    in meaning you mean? it's OK - it has the same meaning (but sounds different yes because it's less formal!)
    Look, this is what I had already written to reply to your earlier question!: Yes the Lake District was lovely – not warm and sunny! – but the weather wasn’t too bad. There aren’t quite so many people in winter either so it’s a bit more peaceful you know? # STUDENT:
    Hmm... I thought few people mean that we rarely see people.",0.996163728,0.008366627
36059,"TEACHER:
    by the way, 'there weren't many people' is a more common order than 'not many people were there'
    um...'few' by itself doesn't give information about frequency
    how can you say the opposite? i.e. in winter there aren't many people but in summer... STUDENT:
    I see. It sounds like 'few' is fewer than 'not many', but it's the same, right?
    In summer there are many people.",0.986692526,0.999368217
36060,"TEACHER:
    ah yes of course I see what you mean - yes it is a bit confusing i guess but yes you're absolutely right
    many people' = formal or normal STUDENT:
    Normal",0.996624915,0.996609749
36061,"TEACHER:
    well....a bit formal to be honest! can you think of another way of saying it? STUDENT:
    Oh, really! In summer, there were a lot of people.
    were ➡︎are",,0.422474938
36062,"TEACHER:
    yeah that's it! Just to be clear: few and many are perfectly correct and fine but...you will hear people use (not) many  and lots
    much more often I mean
    in normal speaking STUDENT:
    I see. So these words sound more natural, right?
    I mean in daily conversation.",0.667861348,0.968274169
36063,"TEACHER:
    yes exactly - in most normal situations (for most people!)
    next time you speak to someone (a native speaker) you'll notice if you think about it! STUDENT:
    Thank you for telling me. That's very helpful for me.",0.922753031,0.429990769

    no problem - Quick practice <STUDENT>: tell me about somewhere you've been in the UK with large and small numbers of people STUDENT:
    Large number: London, Oxford, Cambridge",0.795286805,0.993650819

    Sorry ^^;",0.341177205,0.502587996

    that' ok ha ha STUDENT:
    There are lots of people in London
    while there are not many people in Corby.",0.898825074,0.873016742
36067,"TEACHER:
    ok fine and good for the negative form (you contrct in speech right (aren't)? - 'lots' is fine - a different  word?
    contract STUDENT:
    a lot of
    But didn't you say 'lots' is used more often?",0.799597256,0.998455744
36068,"TEACHER:
    also correct (no difference) ...what about 'loads'? Do you use this word? STUDENT:
    I've never heard 'loads'...",0.757807204,0.999502702
36069,"TEACHER:
    Really? OK, it's really common seriously - I bet you'll notice it now I've mentioned it! STUDENT:
    Oh,Thank you.",0.878178617,0.843217206
36070,"TEACHER:
    it's common in normal informal speech - also can be quite emphatic as in lots and lots! STUDENT:
    So is it used like 'There are loads of people in London'
    ?",0.737665784,0.736053236
36071,"TEACHER:
    Yeah absolutely... or e.g. I went to the swimming pool - there were loads of peopel because it's the school holidays...OK <STUDENT> one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal?
    people
    of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too STUDENT:
    I think it's normal.",0.994941823,0.996740884
36072,"TEACHER:
    ok...it's certainly perfectly possible and correct...can you think of a different word?! STUDENT:
    seldom?",0.823957005,0.589561657
36073,"TEACHER:
    good idea! So in order of formality: seldom, rarely and hardly ever
    you've heard that before? STUDENT:
    So you mean hardly is the most casual? I know these words, but I've never thought about the order of formality.",,0.999496189
36074,"TEACHER:
    yes ' hardly ever' (two words together) is by far the most common in normal speaking. Just to clarify: 'seldom' = correct but very formal i.e. many English people will never have said it in their lives! STUDENT:
    Hardly + ever', I see... He hardly ever  comes to school on time. Like that?",0.999270167,0.996252344
36075,"TEACHER:
    Yep perfect example - and by far the most common form you would hear in everyday life - Quick pronunciation question <STUDENT>: can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' as in opposite of uncle and 'aren't' (are not) STUDENT:
    Yes, I can... Aren't has 'r' sound.",0.351613531,0.99877264
36076,"TEACHER:
    For most British people? STUDENT:
    What do you mean? Do they sound the same in theUK?",0.560659339,0.426208438
36077,"TEACHER:
    Yes exactly they sound exactly the same for me  so e.g. both are: /ɑːnt/  sorry, do you understand the phonemic symbols? STUDENT:
    Oh, really!? Is that like a dialect? I can understand the phonemic symbols.",0.99888362,0.999492781
36078,"TEACHER:
    But of course you can say them how you like <STUDENT>! (as in with an /r/ if you like - I'm just pointing it out for understanding! And Americans and many other English speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. Cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! I like the idea of you telling English peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most English people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral English accent - do you see?
    that's great you can read the symbols by the way - very useful
    now i can write more stuff! STUDENT:
    I see, in Japan there are a lot of dialect, but in the UK, there are many kinds of accent...",0.99567965,0.988218298
36079,"TEACHER:
    Right I see. You know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary right? So in the UK there aren't really many different dialects left but yes 0 as you say - lots of different accents
    have you noticed/heard any difference in accents in the UK STUDENT:
    Interesting. Hmm... My friend said 'scone' has two accents. 'sco:n' and 'scoun'///
    I'm not sure if the symbols are correct",0.999344217,0.994475495
36080,"TEACHER:
    ah  i see - a classic example! Yes good one! I guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? As in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word!
    and peopel who choose the same verision of that word might still have a different accent if you see what I mean?!
    version STUDENT:
    Sorry, I cannot understand. What is the difference?",0.996758661,0.457654257
36081,"TEACHER:
    so if i say /skɒn/ (and i do!) an e.g. Scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are SCottish
    and a person from the south of Egnland like me might say /skəʊn/ (not like me) but i would still hear that they have the same accent as me in general
    sorry <STUDENT> - have i confused you more?! STUDENT:
    Oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as I don't know the background!",0.144272677,0.791115318
36082,"TEACHER:
    ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. Americans normally have an /r/ and most English people don't BUT the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing
    one more <STUDENT> - a really big accent thing: in the south of England we say /a:/  as in /bɑːθ/ and in the north they say /æ/ STUDENT:
    I see. I got it. Ah, how about the word 'staff'? In American English it sounds like /staef/ but in the UK it sounds like /sta:f/",0.99656698,0.990218362
36083,"TEACHER:
    ha! yes great ecample!!!!!!!!
    example
    the same as in America in the north of the UK but less nasal! STUDENT:
    That's interesting.
    Thank you for telling me a lot of things today.",0.995608433,0.597236384
36084,"TEACHER:
    OK thanks a lot <STUDENT> (you see 'many thanks' much more formal!) I'll contact you soon about a further lesson ok? STUDENT:
    Yes, of course it's OK!",0.945322344,0.87362415

    Indeed! How is it going with the lockdown? Here it looks like next week they will remove some restriction...
    *restrictions TEACHER:
    Oh really? I'm so happy for you!
    Well, we're in lockdown until at least March 8, and then there is going to be a phased exit with areas dropping restrictions but others still being quite strict

    I'm feeling for you. Toddlerhood is tough!
    Didn't you say the childminder was still allowed to work?",0.900835716,0.693185985
36093,"STUDENT:
    Yes...luckily she has always been allowed to work, so I had a few free mornings...
    but for a number of reasons she never worked 5 days a week...anyhow, if I didn't go crazy it is probably also thanks to her help TEACHER:
    Good that you have some support! I can only say that it gets easier with time. Just as sweet, but a bit easier :)",0.950747032,0.996727595

    I really hope so :) well, to be onest the oldest child, almost 3, is starting to behave a bit..now it is his brother who is a bit problematic... TEACHER:
    Yes, they call this age 'the terrible twos' here, even though he isn't even 2 yet!",0.952075963,0.915817467
36095,"STUDENT:
    I have hear that expression, yes...we don't have it in Italian, but it should definitely be imported! TEACHER:
    Haha, yes, but the danger is, once you say this, you start to see them in this way
    And three-year-olds are sometimes called 'threenagers'
    Because they can be moody like teenagers",0.14677671,0.360741623

36097,"STUDENT:
    Yes!
    I was just going to say that the last week was extremely busy so I still haven't read the article...but I will! TEACHER:
    There are a couple more that I wanted to share with you
    You don't have to! I just thought it might give you some context, but it's by no means obligatory
    Oh, I think we didn't mention the meaning of 'play up' that is to do with children",0.64536644,0.814320117
36098,"STUDENT:
    Don't worry...it is for me: the more I work on this, the more I learn
    No, we didn't... TEACHER:
    We talked about play up / play down, didn't we?",0.897726588,0.650436118
36099,"STUDENT:
    Yes, even though I can't remember exactly the meaning
    and I am pretty sure children weren't involved TEACHER:
    Yes, you can talk about the crazy English notion of 'class' :)
    Yes, we talked in terms of 'exaggerate / minimize the importantce of'
    *sorry, I meant 'you can learn'",0.887725525,0.784133341
36100,"STUDENT:
    OH yes, now I recall! TEACHER:
    Yes, but 'play up' (or 'act up') has another meaning: start to misbehave
    For example, little Peter is playing up a bit, he must be tired
    The boys have been playing up at school again",0.625430328,0.707260527
36101,"STUDENT:
    My son <STUDENT'S SON> always plays up after finishing a meal. TEACHER:
    After finishing a meal? Because he's full and happy? :)",0.999480803,0.985548205
36102,"STUDENT:
    No, because he's full and realizes that left over food has a big potential, if you want to soil the whole room. TEACHER:
    Haha :))
    Sorry, I shouldn't laugh!",0.643019108,0.999209649
36103,"STUDENT:
    haha, it is funny, until you have to clean up the mess! TEACHER:
    a big potential as an art material
    Definitely

36104,"STUDENT:
    Indeed...well, maybe the story about Cattelan's banana reached even the UK? The artist who used a banana for one of his art pieces...
    Yes, my childminder is giving me a leg up...would it be okay if used like this? TEACHER:
    No, is it a recent story? I haven't heard!
    Hmm, no, unless she paid for your PhD! :))",0.674852676,0.99930465
36105,"STUDENT:
    No, that's not the case ;)
    It's from 2019, so ages ago https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773
    okay...but I am giving a leg up to my children... TEACHER:
    The childminder probably gives your boys a leg up if they want to climb somewhere but can't
    Yes!
    you are giving your children a leg up
    Ah, now I remember, the image rings a bell!
    of a banana I mean",0.999449299,0.935398361
36106,"STUDENT:
    Yes, it is one of those dumb stories that gets a lot of news coverage for a few days...so it would probably ring a beel to almost anyone TEACHER:
    Oh, this is an interesting comment, on the fluidity / rigidity of the class system
    The mistake is assuming that the middle class is closer to the upper class than to the working class. Losing one's job can make you go from middle class to working class in a heartbeat, but most will never even be close to the upper class even if they spend a lifetime doing very well.
    I think there are two nice expressions here, but which one would you pick?
    ones",0.240979835,0.656683601

    in a hartbeat'...meaning in a very short time TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly! a very good one",0.878574067,0.599856029
36108,"STUDENT:
    to be honest I don't see a second one TEACHER:
    Oh, I meant 'to spend a lifetime (doing something)'
    Thinking about it, do well is also a good one
    Also, do well out of... She is a songwriter and is doing surprisingly well out of it
    which means have financial success",0.402425696,0.83479906
36109,"STUDENT:
    Because of covid, many people aren't doing that well right now... TEACHER:
    Exactly!
    Covid cost so many people their livelihoods
    Ok, one last
    I admit it's not rocket science sociology. But the government probably need a commission to help them to understand this. So I hope the writer is doing his bit there.
    Have you heard the expression 'it's not rocket science'?",0.999152796,0.441592049
36110,"STUDENT:
    Yes, to be honest I think it is used more often in the US, could that be the case?
    Anyway, it means 'it is nothing that complex' TEACHER:
    Hmm, I would say it's used in the UK as well!
    Yes, of course! What's a synonymous expression? 'It's not ___ ___'
    that is another field of knowledge",0.996635645,0.910178357
36111,"STUDENT:
    oh... I really don't know...I know many people think math is hard, so I would guess 'It's not like math' but it doesn't sound right TEACHER:
    Nope, but good guess! The expression is 'it's not brain surgery'
    I've got to remember to send you a link to a comedy sketch about these two expressions after class",0.948499729,0.619768588

    I am pretty sure I had never hear that one...okay! TEACHER:
    Do you enjoy English comedy?",0.853191055,0.767320692
36113,"STUDENT:
    Cool :) Yes, I do...to be honest I like it better than Italian comedy, which I find too dumb (as in I want to go outside of the room because it is too ashaming even to watch). TEACHER:
    Oh no! I'm trying to think what I know of Italian comedy. English can be pretty silly but can be quite sophisticated",0.99770431,0.998042045
36114,"STUDENT:
    There are some movies which are produced for Christmas in Italy, called 'cinepanettone' (panettone-movie) which represent this Italian awful comedy... TEACHER:
    There is an English comedy website that does always cheer me up, it's called the Daily Mash. It kind of mimics a newspaper, but the news is satire",0.771633879,0.989469943
36115,"STUDENT:
    Another example is Checco Zalone, his comedy is actually a bit better... TEACHER:
    It especially likes to make fun of middle class people
    Ah, I'm with you, there are awful awful awful comedy shows on TV in the UK, they make me blush too!
    And they also seem to culminate around Christmas",0.958956404,0.977278826
36116,"STUDENT:
    I'll give it a look! We also have such satirical papers in Italian, I guess the most well known is 'lercio' meaning 'filthy'...but to be honest some of their pages are good, and the name is more of a pun with 'leggo' (I read) which is a newspaper. TEACHER:
    Ok, interesting!
    I must warn that it can be quite sweary. But funny!
    I'm thinking back to the expression you used, for something that provokes shame. We can say 'I'm ashamed of', but it doesn't really work with an -ing",0.75885042,0.135462556
36117,"STUDENT:
    Haha, I see...well, to be honest, I believe the italian culture is less concerned with swearing than the anglo-saxon one...I mean, it is a 'bad' thing...but it took me years to understand why on american tv shows they were censoring certain words... TEACHER:
    embarrassing' would probably be a good one here",0.528022231,0.99554857
36118,"STUDENT:
    Okay...yes, I wasn't really sure how to express that...I find italian comedy often embarrassing TEACHER:
    Hmm, actually, I wonder if Americans are more concerned with swearing than Brits
    Brits love to swear, including on TV
    Yes, and a good collocation is 'excrutiatingly embarrassing'",0.839390376,0.99065441

    really? I had never noticed...but then, I don't watch much tv from the UK... TEACHER:
    You know, excrutiating = horribly painful",0.187911859,0.863365751

    Nice :) TEACHER:
    excrutiating pain; excrutiatingly embarrassing",0.692302824,0.471533027
36121,"STUDENT:
    Yes, I know that expression :) TEACHER:
    I can imagine Americans would be more prude about swearing
    Looking at it, I bet it's from Latin too

    Perfect, then I guess see you next week :) Thank you for the lesson and have a nice day! TEACHER:
    Interesting! Knowing Romance languages has definitely given you a leg up in terms of English :)

    Yes, I think the B2 test should be the right level of challenge for you

36268,"TEACHER:
    Aww, I will miss you too! It will be weird, we've been talking for a year now! You always have my Skype if you'd like to message me, right? STUDENT:
    of course
    do you have any plans for summer?",0.991174842,0.745481023
36269,"TEACHER:
    Soo... I understand that your goal is to learn 'all English' and be able to communicate fluently. That's the general goal. But right now, what would you like to be able to do in English? Talk to people? Watch movies? Listen to songs and understand lyrics? Chat to other Roblox players from other countries?
    I do, yes! We're working (and my son is at school) until the end of July, and then we're going on holiday (yaaaay!) to Cornwall. It's a beautiful (and warm!) place in England, in the south-west
    In the meantime, I'm enjoying the beautiful English summer and especially my garden :) STUDENT:
    well, for me it is important to understand what I listen to or what I read, even if I don’t know the word, I can understand it from the other text, by the way, I want to know more about the difference between different English countries
    Is Cornwall a city?
    Wow, you will have only one month of holiday! Why?",0.408380819,0.998107203
36270,"TEACHER:
    Cornwall is a county. Do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the UK being divided into counties? it's like 'oblast' STUDENT:
    oh yeah",0.996909721,0.311700459
36271,"TEACHER:
    Schoolchildren in this country only get 6 weeks of summer holidays, yes!
    If you imagine the map of the UK, Cornwall is in the bottom left corner :) STUDENT:
    that’s sad😢
    oh , makes sense",0.411758452,0.736852514
36272,"TEACHER:
    Yes, it's unusual for us, isn
    isn't it
    But at least it gives parents a chance to work. Not many people would be able to take 3 months off to spend with the kids!
    Back to the UK. It's made up of 4 countries. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are all very different and have their local governments. But of course, there's a general UK government and parliament in London
    But you probably know that, right? STUDENT:
    yes!
    at least I know it from the texts from English books, not from Geography lesson!",0.287145583,0.864499801
36273,"TEACHER:
    Yes, sure, it should be in your English texts!
    Ok, to go back to understanding what you hear and what you read in English!
    The key to understanding is words. I really believe there's no way round it, to learn a language you need to learn lots of new words (and I also think this is the fun part, too!)
    I really recommend a good dictionary. Lots of people use online translations, but a good English-English dictionary that explains instead of translating can do so much more!
    I always recommend Cambridge English dictionary online. You can listen to the pronunciation there too and there are pictures and quizzes! STUDENT:
    Yes , I know that translation words is not as good as understanding them, for example when you speak you remember the translation, not the word",0.997739737,0.998777461
36274,"TEACHER:
    Exactly!
    And then just use your favourite way to memorize words, maybe an app or a notebook or post-it notes
    How do you prefer to learn new words? STUDENT:
    I tried using an app for studying words but it was boring",0.984517826,0.999235395
36275,"TEACHER:
    Ok, sure. Just a notebook always worked for me, especially a small one that I could carry with me everywhere STUDENT:
    if I need to study them I just repeat them a lot of times and if I don’t know the meaning I google it
    also I have a vocabulary notebook, I write words there from the fifth form",0.737069707,0.980917458
36276,"TEACHER:
    Sounds perfect! STUDENT:
    but it is for school, so there are not meanings, just translation",0.784943003,0.878352539
36277,"TEACHER:
    In terms of listening, the trick to understanding is actually pronunciation! Once you start to understand how English pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it!
    Sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right? STUDENT:
    yes",0.963724115,0.766651879
36278,"TEACHER:
    We haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :)
    But! There's a really nice series on the BBC Learning English website
    It's called Tim's Pronunciation Workshop
    It's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully STUDENT:
    I will also check it later
    I found the site",,0.057787778
36279,"TEACHER:
    You can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know
    Perfect! There's lots of fun stuff to do there, too!
    And of course, if you'd like a project, I always recommend reading in English (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the HP books are perfect for this
    The first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. By the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in English and it's easier for you anyway!
    The way I used to approach reading in English was to learn every single new word at first! It's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! There are usually very few new words by the end of the book STUDENT:
    I think I will try
    maybe not the whole book
    something not long",0.943655924,0.959251507
36280,"TEACHER:
    Yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes! STUDENT:
    I think somebody gave me an English book
    as a gift",0.553903449,0.538767303
36281,"TEACHER:
    Obviously, if there's a blog / Insta / tik tok account that you like in English, that could be perfect for smaller texts STUDENT:
    probably I like watching tiktok videos on English
    for example I watch an anime",0.972233648,0.982743766
36282,"TEACHER:
    Oh yes, I think you mentioned it before! STUDENT:
    and there is a Russian side of it
    and there is English side",0.785489172,0.913869309

    Oh, like a comic? STUDENT:
    no, just some videos in tiktok",0.491710234,0.916243367

    Ah sure! STUDENT:
    you see, if you watch anything (anime, serial , film or else ) you can see some different fandom videos on tiktok",0.786647084,0.916899623

    7-8 hours it is not enough for me(((
    I think it can

    No, you probably need 9-10 hours of sleep, right?",0.955672704,0.92406679

    yes TEACHER:
    Definitely! I know people didn't use to recycle, but maybe this situation has changed?",,0.473208606
38183,"STUDENT:
    yes
    For example , in Italy there are a lot of different bins for recycling TEACHER:
    Yes, sure. Are there recycling bins in Ukraine now? I haven't been there for about 4 years now!",0.99936793,0.94471079

    have
    oy no
    used to have TEACHER:
    ah, I'm actually looking for a verb to go with 'habit'
    We can start a habit / develop a habit or have a habit
    start and develop - if it's a new habit",0.687659307,0.873637416

    Yes, correct! Either of them would work

    okie, bye! TEACHER:
    Bye!",0.992880407,0.987949458
38195,"STUDENT:
    Hello! TEACHER:
    Hi <STUDENT>!
    How's it going?",,
38196,"STUDENT:
    Everything good thank you :) How about you? TEACHER:
    Good, thank you! The lockdown's been getting to me this week though...",0.926140531,0.748656688
38197,"STUDENT:
    Oh, I am sorry about that...do you know how long will it last? TEACHER:
    Well, schools are re-opening next Monday, which is some normality I suppose. And I'll be able to see other people at pick-up and drop-off!
    We bought a new car a few weeks ago, but we aren't allowed to go anywhere until March 29
    Which is going to be the second phase of unlocking",0.970612781,0.851903388
38198,"STUDENT:
    Well, school is a start..to think that now we are counting on the opportunity to see other parents when bringing children to school... TEACHER:
    I know, goodness! Just to see other human beings!",0.968778521,0.84975775
38199,"STUDENT:
    I see...here things are more relaxed now, but you need to do a quick test for almost everything...for istance, if I want to go to the office, I have to test every second day. TEACHER:
    I'm very lucky to be locked down with a family, of course. I can't imagine what it's like for single people!",0.35755444,0.333542061
38200,"STUDENT:
    I agree on that one..sometimes I wish for some silence but, to be honest, I believe people living alonge have it much harder... TEACHER:
    Hmm, interesting! The country must be well stocked up on instant tests
    Have you been going to the office?
    Yes, you seem way ahead in terms of being out of lockdown! They haven't even offered a timeframe on the return to offices here",0.333788218,0.858674149
38201,"STUDENT:
    Yes, they are aiming at doing 3 million per week or so, in a country with something like 8.5 million inhabitants. TEACHER:
    Is that all? I thought Austria had a bigger population!
    There are about 66 million in the UK",0.971957556,0.717778515
38202,"STUDENT:
    So far I didn't go: it has opened starting today, but I couldn't get the test done...my wife had the astrazeneca vaccine and suffered from a bad fever as a side effect...
    so the last three days were intense ;) TEACHER:
    Oh I see, sorry to hear that!! Hope she'll feel better very soon!",0.868906084,0.094383795
38203,"STUDENT:
    Today she is better, in fact she is currently out with the children...some silence, finally ;)
    Yes, Austria is small..especially when you think that Wien and its surroundings count 2.5 million inhabitants... TEACHER:
    Interesting! English people spell it 'Vienna'",0.996439578,0.991775651
38204,"STUDENT:
    You are right, also Italian people do...and also Austrian actually...
    I don't know why I went for the German spelling... TEACHER:
    Anyway, the vaccine is a milestone even if it comes at a cost, congratulations to your wife!",0.112617516,0.999112377
38205,"STUDENT:
    Thanks :) TEACHER:
    The Austrians spell it differently from the Germans? I didn't know that either",0.433696975,0.920050822
38206,"STUDENT:
    One thing that I can't really understand is that in Italy they consider University staff as high priority, so a lot of my ex-collegues have been vaccinated...even though they are working remotely most of the time and barely see anyone
    The official German is Wien, I believe...but Austrian tend to have also 'their' version of some words...
    And I have heard them say Vienna.. TEACHER:
    Ah, they've adopted the occupation-based approach then. It's strictly age-based in the UK, the only exception being people with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable",0.807500536,0.998368941
38207,"STUDENT:
    Yes, but currently they are vaccinating people over 80, medical stuff...and then, before school teachers (who see their pupils at school) they went for University staff... TEACHER:
    I've been thinking about you saying 'silence', as in a break from the kids. I would use 'quiet' instead. Or 'peace and quiet'",0.493341488,0.984434142
38208,"STUDENT:
    I don't really understand the ratio...but then, there is little I can do, I only hope that things will speed up :)
    Oh, okay...I guess silence is more of a literary word? TEACHER:
    Oh, now that I'm thinking about it, they vaccinated medical professionals in the first group as well. But school teachers, police etc. don't get a priority, a decision that meets with a lot of criticism
    Silence and quiet (as a noun) are very close, but silence is about the act of not uttering a sound while quiet is about the enjoyable perception of the lack of loud noises
    If it makes any sense",0.991655577,0.983084226
38209,"STUDENT:
    It does..I had never appreciated the difference, thank you for the description!
    So it would be 'I remained silent/in silence' vs 'The house is quiet' TEACHER:
    I just feel it would be more 'English' to say, ah, some peace and quiet at last! (kids are in bed or something like that)
    Yes, exactly!
    Your examples are spot-on",0.985254378,0.994903567
38210,"STUDENT:
    That was just a simple example...but thank you! TEACHER:
    Great, shall we go to the last exercise in the Use of English part of the test? And then I've prepared a bit of linguistic deliciousness for you :)",0.727337252,0.893285823
38211,"STUDENT:
    Yes! Let me find the file TEACHER:
    Please, it's page 6 in the pdf",0.701810674,0.71281979
38212,"STUDENT:
    Part 4, found it! TEACHER:
    Lovely! Key word tranformation, probably the trickiest 'use of English' task.
    which is reflected in the fact that each sentence gets two points, not one, like in the previous tasks
    I mean when it's being marked",0.76379542,0.633226196
38213,"STUDENT:
    I see...let's try
    25. no telling
    25. no telling how long TEACHER:
    You can use 3-8 words for the gap, and the challenge is to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible",0.246192016,0.035601217
38214,"STUDENT:
    nope...I have to think a bit longer for these indeed...
    25. no telling how long it TEACHER:
    Yes, correct! the last option",0.146115392,0.040377852
38215,"STUDENT:
    26. is little demand for TEACHER:
    yes, good!",0.503038279,0.415025127
38216,"STUDENT:
    27. impressed by how good great a (I am not 100% sure about the preprositions 'by' here)
    28. resignation came as a surprise to
    (29 later)
    30. the height of his power TEACHER:
    Hold on, 27. The preposition is good! Also with / at are possible. But 'good' doesn't quite convey the meaning, the answer is 'skilled' or 'skillful'",0.987760111,0.832257057
38217,"STUDENT:
    Interesting...actually I work also on paraphrase problem TEACHER:
    28 = correct",0.338540889,0.663629761
38218,"STUDENT:
    and changing 'skill' with 'good' is the sort of mistake I expect from my models...I should have read the sentence twice! Thank you for pointing it out
    29. was not a tree whatsoever in
    I am really not sure about 29, I am wondering if I should keep the word 'vegetation' TEACHER:
    Yes, this task is different from others, in that paraphrasing is actually discouraged
    Exactly, good idea!
    there was no vegetation whatsoever in/ there was nothing whatsoever growing in
    because there could have been a bush / flower, not necessarily a tree
    And the same issue in 30. How would you change your answer to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible?",0.998080872,0.93031154
38219,"STUDENT:
    I see...I was thinking that 'a tree whatsoever' would convey the meaning of 'a tree or anything similar'...but maybe my understanding of the word whatsoever isn't correct.
    At the height of his success,
    Where I am not sure how you spell 'success'...anyway TEACHER:
    Oh no, whatsoever just means 'absolutely none', it's a way of amplifying 'no'. He has no money/ friends whatsoever.
    Yes, at the height of his success!",0.999391331,0.998586517
38220,"STUDENT:
    OKay :) it was difficult indeed...and, at least from this first attempt, I'd say keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem.
    is the most difficult part of the problem. TEACHER:
    Oh, exactly, and you got all the expressions they are looking for right, I think
    It's about learning the logic of the task
    In writing and speaking, the situation is reverse. You are expected to paraphrase, especially at this level of proficiency
    For example, if the examiner asks you, 'Do you prefer to spend time on your own or with friends?' in a speaking test,",0.691049033,0.794648351
38221,"STUDENT:
    Which means I should definitely prepare for the exam, it shouldn't be too difficult. TEACHER:
    it would be a bit of a waste of opportunity to start saying, 'I prefer to spend my time with friends...' because you've just repeated the question and haven't shown off your English
    When you could have said, 'I'm quite gregarious, and I'm most in my element among people'",0.835178328,0.940212717
38222,"STUDENT:
    I see... TEACHER:
    But in key word transformation, only the necessary paraphrasing!",0.820618686,0.692662298
38223,"STUDENT:
    Okay! It is so difficult for me to talk about my free time
    I mean, in the current situation... TEACHER:
    Haha, yes, I can imagine! It's just an example",0.853557063,0.551885437
38224,"STUDENT:
    I enjoy both company and solitude, even though I would normally tend towards the latter. I enjoy studying and learning.
    But now I have children and I am under a light lockdown, so I am always with my children... TEACHER:
    But again, the skill for the speaking task is to talk at length in a way that shows off your language on any topic. The good news is, you don't ever have to be truthful, just whatever gives your English a chance to shine!
    For example, I wouldn't really describe myself as gregarious, but it was the first C2 word that came to my mind, and I went with it",0.64369986,0.692549649
38225,"STUDENT:
    Haha, I know...this reminds me of Hugh Laurie, when he auditioned for Dr House he lied about where he was staying, because he felt like 'Chicago' was too difficult to say with an american accent (I believe it was Chicago)
    I see...well, if latin words are a plus, it shouldn't be difficult for me... TEACHER:
    Oh really? Love it! (and love Hugh Laurie, one of my favourite actors)",0.989252957,0.950269451
38226,"STUDENT:
    Yes...it was one of his interviews, but finding it now would be like looking for the needle in a haystack TEACHER:
    Ah, speaking of words!
    the promised linguistic treat
    Have you ever heard of Tom Swift books / jokes?
    Yes, a needle in a haystack, true!",0.99949657,0.633161989
38227,"STUDENT:
    no I haven't heard of him... TEACHER:
    I've never read the books, but they are apparently sci-fi for teenagers or something like that
    But! they gave birth to a whole series of jokes that mimick the style of the book
    The jokes are based on puns (do you know this one?)",0.86945539,0.99672471
38228,"STUDENT:
    No, I don't know it sorry... TEACHER:
    a play on the fact that a particular word has more than one meaning
    I'll give you an example
    What's black and white and red (= read) all over? - a newspaper",0.603539272,0.887826911
38229,"STUDENT:
    Oh, now I see! Sorry... TEACHER:
    This is a pun based on the fact that 'red' and 'read' have the same pronunciation",0.73877197,0.284440123
38230,"STUDENT:
    I though you were asking about thi series of jokes, I assumed this was also published as a book or something...
    Okay, I actually knew that a 'pun' was some sort of joke, but I didn't know it involved word's meaning in particular. TEACHER:
    Oh sorry, I confused you! No, I was just trying to say that 'Tom said' jokes are based on some wordplay
    Ok, let's have a look at a couple of jokes, I wonder if you know both meaning of words...",0.999083452,0.997512345
38231,"STUDENT:
    Okay! TEACHER:
    • 'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.
    Here, the play is on the fact that a crypt is a burial place, like a mausoleum, but cryptically means 'with an air of mystery'
    Does it make sense?",,0.652991259
38232,"STUDENT:
    haha...okay, cryptically refers both to in a manner of speaking, as if hiding something, and refers to crypts? The old cemetery
    yes TEACHER:
    Yes!! I needn't have explained it to you :)
    another one
    • 'Pass me the shellfish,' said Tom crabbily.",0.343100148,0.999336484
38233,"STUDENT:
    Hmm...this time you need to explain me...or better, I am pretty sure that crabbiliy refers also to crabs
    but I don't know the other meaning of the word TEACHER:
    Well, yes, it comes from 'crab', but it means grumpy and bad-tempered!",0.999270093,0.994101703
38234,"STUDENT:
    I see TEACHER:
    Good non-Latin word)) The boss is well crabby today or something like that",0.586236083,0.69947332
38235,"STUDENT:
    Haha...okay, I will remember this one! TEACHER:
    Ok, one last!
    Aaand the chatroom decided to crash!",0.845421658,0.773569318
38236,"STUDENT:
    I see
    indeed that's the case TEACHER:
    Ah, I'll have to let you go. Would you like to do the reading tasks in the same pdf?
    If you have the time
    I mean as homework",0.312681856,0.200403804
38237,"STUDENT:
    Okay, I will try to do them!
    Yes, now I have a call TEACHER:
    Great! Ok, sorry, talk to you next week!",0.942502839,0.963412023

    Hi <TEACHER>! TEACHER:
    Hi <STUDENT>!
    How are you? How was your trip?",0.999330952,
38240,"STUDENT:
    Hi! I am good thank you :) It was great! A bit tiring though: we met with a lot of relatives...
    How about you? How are you? TEACHER:
    Sounds lovely!
    Well, I had my first dose a week ago, so yay!
    of the covid vaccine I mean",0.021199126,0.999024575
38241,"STUDENT:
    Of course...Austria just sent the appointments to everyone who asked for the vaccine: I am getting my first dose in a month :) TEACHER:
    Otherwise, we keep waiting for some sun, maybe we'll finally glimpse it this weekend
    Yay! A wait, but at least you have a date I suppose",0.277431542,0.998630128
38242,"STUDENT:
    That's true! The weather was terrible in Italy too...we had only two days without rain TEACHER:
    Really? Well, if even Italy is all rainy, it kind of makes me feel a bit better :)",0.995496719,0.920038764
38243,"STUDENT:
    Haha...in Italy we have a saying 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy) TEACHER:
    Haha, exactly! :)
    I wonder what the saying is in English, there should be something...",0.984390539,0.943224727
38244,"STUDENT:
    But I didn't have time for the writing, sorry...we really travelled a lot!
    miserly loves company...maybe
    (I found it with google, I didn't know it) TEACHER:
    No worries! I'm taking the next week off teaching because my son will be on holiday, so if you still want to do it, you'll have some extra time",0.827328809,0.813677831
38245,"STUDENT:
    That's great! Agreed! TEACHER:
    Yes, kind of 'misery loves company', hmmm
    But the Italian one is more joyful!",0.534323167,0.270532327
38246,"STUDENT:
    Yes, at least it mentions something that isn't misery.. TEACHER:
    Lovely! Also, I am sad to say that we will be closing the teaching project on June 18, which means that we will only have the time for two classes, between June 7 and June 18",0.759219891,0.987197429
38247,"STUDENT:
    I see :) Okay, well it was a nice opportunity so I can only be thankful abou it
    And I am curious to see what sort of reserach they do on the papers: I'll follow the professor who I first contacted for this opportunity ;) TEACHER:
    Yes, it's been a pleasure on my part, and of course, we are very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself",0.823932657,0.640416942
38248,"STUDENT:
    It's been a pleasure for me too! TEACHER:
    I think they're taking the research in more than one direction at the moment. Yes, I'm sure you can contact <RESEARCHER> for more information if you're curious, he did mention it",0.121921696,0.993746104
38249,"STUDENT:
    Cool, thank you :) It would be cool if I eventually end up working also on the data I contributed to generate... TEACHER:
    Ok, so the question is, what would you like to focus on in our remaining time? I've been planning to look at some more speaking questions from C2 proficiency today",0.747717475,0.811320907
38250,"STUDENT:
    (If they release it openly)
    Okay, let's look at speaking questions! TEACHER:
    Yes, <RESEARCHER> would be a better person to speak to about this than myself!
    It would be cool if I eventually end up working also on the data I contributed to generate
    I feel that 'also' is a bit out of place here. What would be a better place for it?",0.902480674,0.991453407
38251,"STUDENT:
    Oh, the also is in the wrong position there, right?
    Yep TEACHER:
    haha, yes! You see it yourself, don't you?",0.357123991,0.254308115
38252,"STUDENT:
    I could either remove it, or...maybe...I could put it before 'working': end up also working ... TEACHER:
    Yes! I like it before 'working'.",0.999366454,0.317062361
38253,"STUDENT:
    Yes and no...but now, everytime I write it an alarm bel rings in my head so I try to pay more attention (not in that case, apparently) TEACHER:
    also working' - like other researchers
    It's German interference, isn't it? I can just hear 'arbeiten auch' in my mind",0.738758621,0.550672216
38254,"STUDENT:
    Yes...moreover German has an interjection which is written 'also', has a slightly different sound...
    The way we use 'anche' in Italian, which is the closes word to 'also' we have, is also different... TEACHER:
    Aah, yes, I remember! indeed",0.589397718,0.989123504

    So it is really tricky for me ;) TEACHER:
    I can imagine!",0.884917222,0.897125515
38256,"STUDENT:
    *the closest
    Anyway, practise makes perfect :) As you see if I think about it I am starting to correct it! TEACHER:
    Ok, C2 questions! I think I mentioned last time that there are several parts to the speaking test, and in the first part the questions are focused on you rather than abstract
    I'm warning you, some of them are a bit weird, you'll have to just roll with them and show off your English!",0.384319089,0.486648402
38257,"STUDENT:
    Okay, that's fine! TEACHER:
    You'll see what I mean (I'll start with not so weird ones though)
    The test always begins with, please tell us your name, are you a student or do you work and then maybe 'where are you from', no need to answer those now
    Next question: You said you are from Friulli (did I get that right??) Is that an interesting place to live?",0.684480917,0.718046668
38258,"STUDENT:
    Those are the easy ones..
    Yes, I am originally from Friuli (just one 'l'). TEACHER:
    yep, they give the examiner a chance to fill in the papers :)
    Sorry! Friuli",0.989455677,0.998264003
38259,"STUDENT:
    It depends on what you mean by 'interesting'. It is a small, rural region which was among the poorest in Italy before the so called Italian economic miracle of the sixties... TEACHER:
    Ok, lovely! Feel free to add another sentence or two",0.659378639,0.413371448
38260,"STUDENT:
    I find it interesting because you can experience nature in all its forms: from mountains, to the sea side...and, as any place in Italy, it has many places that are interesting as far as history is concerned.

    In this sense it is quite interesting :) But I would use the word quiet to describe it: if you look for a thrilling night life you should look somewhere else. TEACHER:
    Ok, thanks! Great sophisticated grammar, I like it! It would be helpful to use some synonyms to 'interesting' though, such as...",0.966984958,0.565996152

    ok, it is better than my sentence. TEACHER:

    All good, thank you!
    Thanks for your essay, I really enjoyed reading it! Some very nice language there :)

    Thank you :) As I explained: it took me a while to write it, but I thought that sometimes trying to perfect one's language can be a good exercise :) TEACHER:
    Yes, absolutely. If you were in a situation where you have to observe the time limit such as an exam, I'd suggest sticking to a very clear structure with topic sentences, It does speed up the process!

    Maybe I should start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph ;) It took me a long time to write it for multiple reasons, among them the fact that I rewrote someparts...
    *some parts TEACHER:
    Yes, a boring but reliable structure. 1. Introduction (signposting early what you're going to write about) 2. topic sentence, expansion 3. topic sentence, expansion

    Yes, of course :) The problem is that it is difficult to be 'creative' with such a structure...
    since it is a topic that I'm interested in I had plenty to write about in 'my way'...but, of course, for an exam it's better to choose some topics
    and produce just what you're asked for :) TEACHER:
    Yes! But it's also difficult to steer away from the topic and get lost, which is a problem with a lot of exam writing (not yours, actually)

    Yes, I do have something prepared, we'll get to it in a second, just wanted to check with you first
    You probably do it anyway, but I do recommend reading good quality media in English, I do believe it helps with the language a lot!

    Oh, I also read a lot of scientific articles on machine learning, but the quality of the language there is mixed... TEACHER:
    Right, sure, the quality of the language is not the main point there I can imagine

    It should be of some concern...but currently the pace at which articles in ML (machine learning) is out of control...which leads to lower quality in many aspects (including language)

    Interesting! You're in a very dynamic field

    Okay! I have the book here, but I don't remember the page... TEACHER:
    One second, I'll find it
    A fad? Very interesting, coming from you! As I said before, my main objection from the user side of it is 'artificial empathy'. It just doesn't work in my opinion!

    It's about a poor musician called Anton who lived in a small fishing village. He and the daughter of a rich fisherman, Barbara, were in love, and he went to her father to ask for her hand. The father said that he had to have a boat to be able to marry his daughter and provide for her. But Anton did not have a boat, only his guitar! Anton went to his friend Chris, a fisherman, and asked to borrow his boat. But Chris refused him saying that he needed the boat for work. Barbara and Anton broked up. Heartbroken, Anton proposed to another girl, Elizabeth, but Elizabeth said he was still in love with Barbara and turned him down. Anton was unhappy and unmarried then. But who was to blame?

    They are indeed, but to be fair I was a bit dubious about which verb to use...
    grown TEACHER:
    lend (lent, lent) = let someone temporarily have something that belongs to you
    borrow: borrow some money from a bank, borrow a book from the library, May I borrow your pen, please?
    And which of them is a synonym of 'loan'?",0.44010848,0.495703083
38339,"STUDENT:
    I see :) The difference is between the fact that you are actively 'giving' something or 'taking' something...
    A loan is something you ask to the bank, so I'd go for 'borrow'...
    But I didn't know load is a verb too TEACHER:
    Yes! Like in Italian, it's the same verb in my native language, so I could recognize the problem :) But there's a very clear distinction in English. Also, you don't use 'have' instead of 'borrow'
    There's a big difference between 'you can have it' and 'you can borrow it'!

    Haha I know :) Unless you say something like 'you can have it for a couple of days, but I need it this Sunday' TEACHER:

    Which one is more common? TEACHER:

    from what I've managed to find
    BC is the optimal choice I guess TEACHER:

    I know! He's lucky because he's one of the oldest kids in his class. In the UK, children start school in September after their 4th birthday, and there are some kids with August birthdays in his class. They are still babies, 11 months younger than <TEACHER'S CHILD>!
    We wanted to take him out to eat at his favourite cafe, but he was so tired he wanted to go home! So we ended up ordering a pizza. STUDENT:

    Well, he did play with his friend next door on Saturday, and <TEACHER'S HUSBAND>'s parents are coming this weekend. We couldn't have a party this year because you can't have more than 6 people together socializing STUDENT:

    We gave him a game table where you can play table football, air hockey, ping pong and snooker

    It's the bread you make without shop-bought yeast. You ferment flour and water for a while until it produces it's own yeast
    It's not difficult but it takes a few days to make that sourdough starter!

    I see! Actually this sort of bread is better than with shop-bought yeast I think",0.988338956,0.999305415

    How are you?",,

    Great, thank you! How about you? TEACHER:
    All good, thanks. It's been unseasonally warm here",0.962877659,0.936654207

    Really? Here it is quite cold... TEACHER:
    Oh interesting! Maybe our warmth will soon reach you guys, or maybe vice versa, we'll get your cold weather",0.995343124,0.992158399
39094,"STUDENT:
    We shall see...I hope it will get a bit warmer, it really went from summer to winter weather  in a matter of days TEACHER:
    How's the lockdown going for you? Are there any aspects you're enjoying or is a survival for you, with two young kids and working from home?
    I wonder if the climate in Austria is less affected by the ocean, with it being landlocked, so you're getting more of a contrast of seasons",0.97852137,0.998872948
39095,"STUDENT:
    Well...currently it is mostly a curfew, at least the children go to the childminer in the morning.
    So, currently I am doing fine...I hope they'll let the childminer work, though, because the few hours of silence during the morning make a big difference. TEACHER:
    Ah, I see! That's good. It's a childminDer. Someone who minds other people's children, as in looks after them",0.924529484,0.690452037
39096,"STUDENT:
    Well...yes, Austria has a bit more of a continental climate...but Graz is relatively close to Slovinia and the sea, so it shoud have the best weather. TEACHER:
    a few hours of quiet, yes",0.323672666,0.006101163
39097,"STUDENT:
    At least, this is what they told me.
    Oh! I must have read it wrong the first time: I was wondering about what 'miner' and 'keeping children' had in common...
    Thank you for catching it :) Childminder it is, then! TEACHER:
    You sound a bit disappointed in the weather :)  I bet it's quite an adjustment for you. It still is for me!
    Yes, no miners! :)",0.980018516,0.557654143
39098,"STUDENT:
    Haha...well, actually my hometown is quite a rainy place...but in Trieste I got used to a very nice weather.
    How was the week of vacation? I guess the warm weather was a plus for you! TEACHER:
    It rained for most of the week (of course!) But we had a lovely relaxing time, thank you
    The warm weather has only just started, really
    Did you move to Graz for your job / research then?",0.999075822,0.992308634

    Oh...well, then who knows how long it will last...
    Yes, I moved here for my job: it is a very good position...and it is relatively close to my home region: without the corona it takes less about three hours by car TEACHER:
    Sure. Could you fill in the gap: If it wasn't __ corona, it would take less than 3 hours",0.999101906,0.988450546
39100,"STUDENT:
    for
    I think... TEACHER:
    Yes, cool. Just checking :)
    Mind you, every time the weather is particularly warm, which I love, there is always a thought at the back of my mind, is it actually the result of climate change and not something to be particularly happy about?",0.78375018,0.603533433
39101,"STUDENT:
    I agree with you on that one. Climate is more concerned on the weather over time...so a single day of warm could just be okay... TEACHER:
    Yes, but when there is a pattern, there is something to worry about",0.726133762,0.999260661
39102,"STUDENT:
    The problem is that it happens so often and that the temperature is so high.
    Indeed...climate change, unfortunately, is a complex problem: everyone should mint it.
    *mind it... TEACHER:
    Yes, well, hopefully, it's not too late to act on this one!",0.450019192,0.654970561

    that TEACHER:
    so",,0.90001586
39105,"STUDENT:
    Okay...I agree that 'I hope so too' sounds better, but I wouldn't know why. Is it just how the verb 'hope' works? TEACHER:
    Just thinking how to explain it best",0.745729291,
39106,"STUDENT:
    (for this particular case) TEACHER:
    One second
    Hope doesn't take a direct object
    which makes it an 'intransitive' verb
    I hope for the best
    we need 'for' here
    Alternatively, we need a clause
    I hope that we will be able to avert climate change",0.72836732,0.782698693
39107,"STUDENT:
    I see! Wow, this is definitely an italian-related mistake, since in italian 'to hope' is transitive.
    I hope that I learn how to use the verb to hope TEACHER:
    Aha, that will be it then, it's language 1 interference for you
    Exactly!
    And of course, it can be a noun as you know",0.973051396,0.99235856
39108,"STUDENT:
    I hope to learn this.' would also be incorrect, right?
    I mean, 'to learn' would be the direct object in that case TEACHER:
    Oh yes, I hope to do something - perfectly fine
    no, a direct object would be a noun or something that can function as a noun
    read a book
    book - direct object",0.999345573,0.846387671
39109,"STUDENT:
    okay...I don't know why I included anything answering to 'what?/who?' under the definition of direct noun. TEACHER:
    Remember we were talking about the British vs. US use of write?
    In British English, I write a letter to my teacher. A letter = direct ofject; to my teacher = indirect object",0.994046654,0.998147728
39110,"STUDENT:
    Yes, I remember vaguely: in the US people omit the 'to', but I can't exactly remember in which case. TEACHER:
    You know what, you're actually right. 'to learn' is an infinitive object
    Now that I think about it
    In US English, you can say, I'll write you a letter. or She hasn't written me
    In UK English: She hasn't written to me",0.959141579,0.878251075

    I'll write to you a letter. TEACHER:
    I'll write a letter to you
    direct object before the indirect one :)",0.999158597,0.998102113
39112,"STUDENT:
    Indeed...ordering problem there.
    About the 'I hope to learn'...so would it be correct to use hope + infinitive object? TEACHER:
    Yes, of course
    hope to Verb; hope for Noun; hope that Clause",0.993108538,0.834955551

    Okay, I'll write that down. Thank you! TEACHER:
    hope for the best (not a noun, but a very common expression)",0.63261383,0.753830183
39114,"STUDENT:
    I see, I would add that 'hope for the best' is a common expression given the current times. TEACHER:

    First part is fine

    and we need both parts to work",0.601168904,0.96870676
39117,"STUDENT:
    Hmmm...
    It's a must-read for every SpaceX / Tesla fan
    that is how I would correct that part...but then, would the parallel structure work?
    I guess not... TEACHER:
    You can still make it work for both parts

    who is TEACHER:
    Yes!! correct
    Do you see how it would make both parts agree grammatically?",0.186445674,0.678564474

    anyone who is insterested in... anyone who is (a) Tesla fan

    Correct! I was just typing about that :)

39121,"STUDENT:
    Lesson learned: from now on I will try to split parallel structures and check them separately.
    Otherwise I find it difficult to find this sort of problems. TEACHER:
    Ok! I'm sure you will soon develop a feel for that
    Ok, the next bit presents a similar challenge. Not a parallel structure, but also a grammatical agreement problem
    I found this book interesting, though being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to read/follow  and some concept are, I believe, oversimplified.
    Being packed with ideas, it sometimes makes it hard to follow...",0.997641206,0.597635865
39122,"STUDENT:
    Being packed with ideas makes it sometimes hard to follow.
    Would that be better? Even though i don't really like the expression 'being packed with ideas' TEACHER:
    Very good correction! You've made 'being packed with ideas' the subject
    Otherwise, being packed with ideas doesn't agree with 'it'
    because you mean 'the book', not 'it' from the clause 'it makes it hard to read'
    How would you correct this sentence? 'Having lost my glasses, it was hard for me to read'",0.999504085,0.999498758

    Mmm...I am thinking TEACHER:
    Let me know if you don't see the problem with it :)",0.685811297,0.713914007
39124,"STUDENT:
    Changing the second part to 'made it hard for me to read' is an option, probably...
    The 'it' is not referring to 'having lost my glasses' (which is the subject) TEACHER:
    Yes, definitely",0.780766803,0.578989463
39125,"STUDENT:
    But I can't think of what would be the correct word instead of 'it' TEACHER:
    But if you wanted to keep 'having lost my glasses', it would be something like 'Having lost my glasses, I was struggling to read'
    Because I lost my glasses, not 'it'
    You need the same subject in them",0.944393752,0.82334983
39126,"STUDENT:
    I see...so there was not way to simply 'correct' the word 'it'. TEACHER:
    No, you'd need to re-structure it
    It's a very common higher-level learner mistake",0.879948357,0.849164999
39127,"STUDENT:
    I see...well, it looks rather difficult to find TEACHER:

    I might prepare it for the next time if you don't mind
    What would you suggest instead of 'packed with ideas'?",0.824998875,0.486491842
39129,"STUDENT:
    Mmm...good question...I guess 'full of ideas' would sound better.

    hmm, 'full of ideas' sounds more like praise, doesn't it?
    the book can be hard to follow due to a plethora of ideas",0.999018434,0.999154069

    Hi David,  It sounds great that your friends are going to have a holiday in my city. As you know, Beijing is the capital of China, so it’s an excellent choice for a holiday. There are a lot of places where they may want to visit, let me introduce some of them. If they want to experience the culture of China, they should go to somewhere like The Palace Museum and Nanluoguxiang where they can see the Chinese historical royal buildings and  eat the classic Chinese food. Also they can visit the Great Wall which is the symbol of Chinese history. And in the Great Wall, they can see the beatiful scenery of Beijing. By the way, because Beijing is one of the biggest cities in China, during the holiday, I think they can travel by subway. In Beijing Subway is so convinient that they can travel to almost all places they want. At last, hope they would have a great time in Beijing, if they have any problem, they can connect with me.     Thanks,     <STUDENT>

    yes it's very effective (i was doing lessons on Zoom for a bit) STUDENT:

    Do they use any other functions to allow/control participation? e.g. chatbox/take control of the screen function/whiteboard/screenshare (even?)/ sharing files?
    Sorry go on... STUDENT:
    Maria and I went to the park', 'Maria and me....',  'She and me...' , 'she and I...'
    My question is about when we use in these type of sentences 'me' or 'I'?",0.745691907,0.362583847
39325,"TEACHER:
    OK so ... basically in normal everyday speaking we often say ... me and Maria/Maria and me = common
    MAria and I' = more careful and some people feel this is the 'correct' way .... in writing you;d usually  see thi sform STUDENT:
    Then both are correct?",0.991681107,0.573650509
39326,"TEACHER:
    In a test or if you want to copy a more careful (pedantic?!) native speaker then e.g. my friend and i = the correct option
    YOu will here tens of millions of people say the other way too (including me) so in this sense it is correct too yes STUDENT:
    Great, clear now... I thought that one was wrong... I was concern about using it wrongly",0.781691764,0.867582184
39327,"TEACHER:
    Yes I understand ... they are both absolutely correct in the sense of common use ...but yes one is more informal than the other STUDENT:
    Actually we generally hear 'you and me...'
    You and I...' sounds weird, doesn't it?",0.843566447,0.599031421
39328,"TEACHER:
    and SOME people would never say 'me and my friend...'
    yes much less common STUDENT:
    what about 'you and Maria are good friends'?
    You and she/her are good friends??",0.971760287,0.987657748
39329,"TEACHER:
    OK hold on...let me clear my head!
    so you and maria sounds fine
    you and he are good friends = sounds better than you and him (it;s the nominative form)
    more correct yes BUT you will hear people say 'you and him for the subject as in 'you and him can go' but less 'correct'' STUDENT:
    I see... In Spanish it is a very common structure, maybe not so common in English?",0.999377469,0.410532604
39330,"TEACHER:
    Yes i think that's right - that's why even though it seems such a simple phrase it's doesn't come easily to me... STUDENT:
    Yes, that's what I thought",0.914637396,0.706160587

    Hold on ..give me a quick everyday example sentence (transalated from Spanish) if you can... STUDENT:

    Now the same without their names 'she and he (you pointing at them) will work together??",0.527041184,0.483568129

    yes i see ... aahhhh STUDENT:
    or she and him??
    maybe you just say 'you two will work together' (pointing at them)",0.659383137,0.775861536
39333,"TEACHER:
    she and he would be correct yes but just sounds weird because you'd say 'they'

    I see, so let's forget about it... I was translating from Spanish
    Sorry!!!",0.999250063,0.808544223
39334,"TEACHER:
    no that's OK - it's a fair question...just frustrating somehow
    and sorry yes...looking back ...exactly yes 'you two' = again the normal way STUDENT:
    No frustration! I got it :)
    And another much easier question!!",0.940133373,0.933058336
39335,"TEACHER:
    OK... STUDENT:
    Last day (or the last day??) we talk, when we said good by to each other you said 'have a good one'
    what does that sentence mean? Have a good day?",0.589258959,
39336,"TEACHER:
    The last time we talked/when we talked the other day......and yes...have a good day is the origin i guess..but we kind of use it indiscriminately to mean e.g. weekend or whatever OR just see you later alternative! informal but normal for many people
    sorry i'm using such lazy writing there! (ellipsis etc) STUDENT:
    I see, thanks
    no worries!!",0.999443572,0.906744045
39337,"TEACHER:
    Yes so many little phrases for hello/goodbye i guess! which ones did you pick up?
    I was always say 'hasta luego' i think in Spanish and never anything else!
    I don't know if that matters or not really! STUDENT:
    Not many I think... For hello just hi or hello
    and for goodbye see you, bye (never goodbye, I don't know why)",0.758199084,0.993489455
39338,"TEACHER:
    Yes sure well that's fine! 'alright?' is of course very common right? STUDENT:
    some people say just 'later'?",0.70465573,0.310236492
39339,"TEACHER:
    um...'later' by itself is only used by some young people i would say....but possible yes (or 'laters' -= another form used by some young people....god this is making me feel old!) STUDENT:
    haha",0.99947281,0.763453001
39340,"TEACHER:
    most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see YOU if you see what i mean) STUDENT:
    and night for goodnight
    no sorry, I don't understand the explanation of 'seeya'",,0.997373396
39341,"TEACHER:
    Yes so your idea about 'goodbye' being unusual is correct  - 'bye' by itself = a thousand times more normal ...'goodbye' sounds very final/formal (weird!)
    So obviiously we say 'see you' and miss out the 'later ' at the end VERY often ...BUT many (most!) students pronounce the 'you' with a strong form of the vowel you know? STUDENT:
    Yes",0.991576242,0.850230558
39342,"TEACHER:
    BUt we use the weak form (the 'schwa' remember?) and it sounds weird otherwise
    so in writing this is represented as 'ya' STUDENT:
    yes",,0.541410891
39343,"TEACHER:
    OK STUDENT:
    question if we change the pronunciation the meaning changes?",,
39344,"TEACHER:
    Um...no sorry I didn't mean that ...hold on asec.. STUDENT:
    Ahhh okk
    Ahhh okk",0.654068824,0.740282111
39345,"TEACHER:
    So non-native don't use weak forms very much it' s true and it basically doesn't matter that much really BUT we do yes and it can change the meaning
    But we understand that if you use them/don't use them it's not changing the meaning because you only have one form!
    you see what  i mean? STUDENT:
    Yes I see
    <TEACHER> : most common = seeya (as in pronounced like that i mean ...never see YOU if you see what i mean)",0.59514701,0.995768056
39346,"TEACHER:
    OK! it's just taht for some reason the non-native failure to use the weak vowel in the phrase  'see ya' is particularly noticeable ... but it doesn't really matter! STUDENT:
    I got the idea of a different meaning after reading that sentence I copied above",0.993862933,0.866034657
39347,"TEACHER:
    Yes i see what you mean - tricky to talk about pronunciation issues in this format!
    I do a lot of pronunciation normally in classes STUDENT:
    sure, again we miss the audio!",0.795543607,0.539227751
39348,"TEACHER:
    yes oh well STUDENT:
    Then, you suggest that I don't use 'see ya'

    Oh no - it's fine !
    Keep using it no problem! STUDENT:

    no, never
    ahh yes",,0.955337088
39351,"TEACHER:
    Ah interesting! That's what i use very often ... STUDENT:
    but I thought it meant Are you alright?",0.662204892,0.560337778
39352,"TEACHER:
    OK ..this is very common informally (not everyone uses it )
    Ah yes i see...it CAN mean this BUT it's just become so generuc
    generic... STUDENT:
    ahhh",0.176194053,0.650353015
39353,"TEACHER:
    so the other person will just reply 'alright' - you see?!
    it's not a real question
    but you CAN answer it a real question if you like! STUDENT:
    I don't like it! Same in Spain... we could say 'qué tal?' instead of 'hola'",,0.488197894
39354,"TEACHER:
    as a real question i mean
    Yes i see...I always found it intimidating when Spanish people said e.g. Que pasa/que dices .... STUDENT:
    I don't like it because the person who is saying 'qué tal?' usually is not interested in if you are well or not",0.990139649,0.981462302

    like i had to have some interesting answer
    yes i see!
    What about 'cheers' for 'bye' ? Have you noticed that much? STUDENT:
    haha I don't think they are expecting an interesting answer... I think it's just a different way of saying hello",0.736748907,0.996646151

    ready with the papee
    paper TEACHER:
    Lovely!
    Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.  1) Some people think ads are fun and can brighten up both city and rural landscapes, can be informative and help  2) Others think their ubiquity is annoying even dangerous at times, especially towards vulnerable groups of people  3) I think ads are OK when there's an option to mute or cancel them. In real world it's almost impossible to achieve. Thus, I only support ads on the internet",0.436775613,0.916870261

    So I read again. Then try to write an essay including my previous sentences

    One quick question TEACHER:
    Sure",0.963571759,0.718252291
39387,"STUDENT:
    WHat do you think the author means by 'digital advertising' in the second article?
    Digital billboards
    or internet ads
    I mean, digital billboards on the streets TEACHER:
    That's a good question, I've been thinking myself! I think they mean digital billboards, because it needs to correlate with the first paragraph
    and the contrast is, posters in the past vs. digital billboards now
    or at least it must be!",0.999483249,
39388,"STUDENT:
    Ok. So it probably correlates with the previous artcile
    article TEACHER:
    Yes, it should! Two views of the same thing",0.975006472,0.987804154

    If that's not the case then I would have argued differently. Hence the question TEACHER:

39391,"STUDENT:
    Something about that there's no escape from the advertising frenzy, neither online, not offline. And you'll have to become immune at some point and maybe teach your children to do the same, see through things
    neither ... nor TEACHER:
    Yes, I see!
    Your original point was that we have no choice when exposed to billboards, we can't block them like on the Internet",0.988389632,

    Yes. TEACHER:
    Shall we go at paragraphs one by one, and then you choose which idea you'd like to express? or potentially both",,0.602824341
39393,"STUDENT:
    That's if we think about digital boards on the streets

    I think it's a very promising one, easy to write about!",0.783001959,0.967019182

    You may think it's necessary or you may be appalled - one thing is clear, there's little you can do about it. However, this is only partly true for the virtual world. TEACHER:
    Right, I'm just thinking... are we still in the introduction part?
    There's surely more than one way about it, but shall we say for now,  1)a general introduction 2) opinion 1 3) opinion 2 4) your opinion",0.912575754,0.280725353

    I'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes - even those people have an ad-blocker installed on their Pcs.

    Ok, that's a great sentence, but you are going back to billboards, aren't you??

    I'm trying to continue what I wrote last time.
    Or we're doing a new version?
    So I need more introduction then, right? TEACHER:
    No, you're right, we're building on the old one!
    I would say so, and then proceed to the next paragraph that can start with a topic sentence
    Boring, but well-structured!

    Hi there... STUDENT:
    hey, I am here",,0.993057093
39408,"TEACHER:
    OK so,  let's have a think about this again <STUDENT> OK? Don't answer yet but here is what we're going to do:  'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'
    So <STUDENT>....what action happened first? you seeing the table or me teaching you? STUDENT:
    I seeing table firstly",0.458296777,0.999496815
39409,"TEACHER:
    Are you sure? Was i your teacher before that?! STUDENT:
    wow..you teach us first and then gave to us the table chart",0.511068176,0.543939732
39410,"TEACHER:
    OK good! And was I also your teacher After you saw the table? STUDENT:
    yes, you are also my teacher.",0.998768319,0.998838612
39411,"TEACHER:
    OK fine! So we have two actions right? ONE of them ('seeing the table' ) happened 'inside' the other - the second one existed (me teaching you) existed before, during AND after the other
    So do we use the past simple for BOTH actions? STUDENT:
    no,,I think one of them is past perfect",0.972121116,0.956790095
39412,"TEACHER:
    Ah ok I see your idea...well past perfect is some that happened BEFORE something else -BUT this is different because the other thing happened before, DURING and AFTER OK? STUDENT:
    yes",0.998278488,0.669967077
39413,"TEACHER:
    OK <STUDENT> so imagine: I look out of my window and I see a man i have never seen before OK? Maybe I ask myself: At the moment...what ________(do)?
    Choose a tense <STUDENT> to complete the question! STUDENT:
    what are you doing?
    what should I do?",,0.573715549
39414,"TEACHER:
    OK yes good exactly: 'what's he doing? ' and the answer maybe is: 'Nothing special ...He ___ just ____ (walk) along the street' STUDENT:
    He is just walking along the street.",0.338329639,0.999495911
39415,"TEACHER:
    OK good thanks hold on
    So two action right? Which one started first? (the seeing or the walking?) STUDENT:
    walking is the first action",0.943678706,0.999031689
39416,"TEACHER:
    OK good fine so...we have two tenses: the present simple and the present continuous OK? STUDENT:
    and during he is walking, I saw him, after I seeing him, he still walking along the street.",0.778170193,0.097066905
39417,"TEACHER:
    yes exactly good! So the seeing is 'inside' the walking! STUDENT:
    yes,ok",0.990973086,0.62666214
39418,"TEACHER:
    SO...your original sentence was : 'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'
    THis is in the past it's true but the logic is the same... STUDENT:
    so...I saw the table when you teaching us. because you are my teacher before you give to me the table and during you giving and after you giving to me",,0.996219276
39419,"TEACHER:
    So the first verb is in the past simple good ...and the second needs to be the....??
    Yes yes that's it! STUDENT:
    wow..I got it
    I never understand it before you teaching me this stuff.",0.967073203,0.49166602
39420,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's ok ...So you need the PAST CONTINUOUS - how do we make it? We need to two parts remember? the PRESENT continuous = is/are + ____ing and the PAST continuous? STUDENT:
    was/were + __ing",0.953605626,0.999216514
39421,"TEACHER:
    OK great so...'I__________ it when you ____  ______ us.'?? STUDENT:
    I saw it the when you were teaching us.",0.584143466,0.986378743

    OK fantastic - you've got it STUDENT:
    yes!! thanks",0.92348674,0.627160814

    So <STUDENT> let's just use this a bit before you forget it! Hold on.... STUDENT:
    ok",0.821805013,0.763321685
39424,"TEACHER:
    So I can say about myself for example: 1. I saw the first Lord of the Rings film when I was living in Spain. 2. yesterday I was driving to the supermarket when I saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. I was going to school when I realized my phone was at home. etc etc ...Can you think of a couple of examples (true if possible - but they don't have to be interesting!) for yourself?) STUDENT:
    I  understood the stuffs of present continuous when I was study online.
    I understood the stuffs of present continuous when I was studying online.",,0.340594795

39428,"TEACHER:
    yes OK i see - it'll get more automatic over time if you keep practising...
    <STUDENT> - let me give you a couple of examples about how you can use the present perfect or present continuous in IELTS essays OK? Hold on a sec.... STUDENT:
    okey, I still practising this sentence after class.",0.72707123,0.988792129

    okey",0.943514592,0.894548357

    yes, I like",,0.962343529
39431,"TEACHER:
    Hi sorry - internet went out there for a minute
    OK <STUDENT> so let me give you a few typical sentences for essay introductions and we can think about the use of the present perfect/present continuous....hold on
    Remember the problem and solution essay we did in class about the lack of teachers? STUDENT:
    yes ,it is always happen...firstly I am unhappy with that.. but I rebased I need to clam down and get a good mood with this problem.",0.171789883,0.417394584

    Yes you're right ...count to ten and keep calm.... STUDENT:
    yes, I still remembering the easy of problem and solution.",0.504973365,0.631787319
39433,"TEACHER:
    OK right...so in the intro maybe we might want to say (for the background sentence) something like: ' The number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' Can you put the verb in the right tense? STUDENT:
    decline
    decrease",0.698514179,0.280391976
39434,"TEACHER:
    So you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! But what tense??
    you can copy the verb STUDENT:
    declined/decreased/went down",0.49129702,0.663470961
39435,"TEACHER:
    OK thanks so you;ve chosen the past simple which maybe seems logical BUT the time phrase 'in recent decades' means UP TO AND INCLUDING NOW so....we need the...?? STUDENT:
    in this intro, do we need the structure of ' it is argued that...'
    we need the present continuous",0.72607087,0.974009287
39436,"TEACHER:
    Um....not really beacuse the lack of teachers would be given as a fact not an opinion or disagree with you see?
    to agree or disagree with i mean STUDENT:
    okey,i understand",0.793373641,0.682974977
39437,"TEACHER:
    OK so if i say 'this year' has the time finished? STUDENT:
    if we got the date of this year I think it finished.",0.764872295,0.999305172
39438,"TEACHER:
    Ah well if we say e.g. 24th March 2020 then yes it;s finished BUT if we ONLY say 'this year' has it finished? STUDENT:
    no ,it not finished
    so we use present simple
    or present continue",0.999106468,0.998820387
39439,"TEACHER:
    OK good - so some time phrases AUTOMATICALLY need the past simple OR the present perfect OK? It depends on the phrase STUDENT:
    okey, I understand.",0.998548696,0.165481937
39440,"TEACHER:
    So e.g. last year/last week/2018/ = ? (past simple or present perfect?) STUDENT:
    present simple because it is specific time",0.86106798,0.999128459
39441,"TEACHER:
    OK fine (you mean past simple right?!) STUDENT:
    yes",0.998440351,0.831748772
39442,"TEACHER:
    OK!
    OK good! and one more...what about 'this morning'  ? Past simple or present perfect?
    IN real life today! STUDENT:
    this morning is...past simple I guess",,0.999445521
39443,"TEACHER:
    Yes good! STUDENT:
    because everyday and every time is specific.",0.710767275,0.865402161
39444,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's right - OK so finally: 'in recent decades'? Past simple or present perfect? Remember the logic of the essay question is : We have a problem NOW with a lack of teachers. STUDENT:
    let me think
    past simple!",0.8595681,0.997307724
39445,"TEACHER:
    OK so remember the result will be either: 'In recent decades the number of teachers has gone down...' OR 'In recent decades the number of teachers went down.... STUDENT:
    because in recent year is present perfect
    yes..in recent years this problem is big action, NOW is inside it",0.693843391,0.951333871
39446,"TEACHER:
    YEs good! that keyword is 'recent' which makes us use the present perfect in English because ot means up to and including now you see? NOT a finished time with less connection to now... STUDENT:
    yes.. I think I can understand it now",0.998416651,0.774874195
39447,"TEACHER:
    Yes I see what you mean about 'inside it' - i guess that;s true - in other words the number of teachers hasn't exactly STOPPED going down that's right
    We'll do more tomorrow with more essay intros ok? STUDENT:
    yes that is what I like to do",0.276066878,0.204559605

39454,"STUDENT:

39457,"STUDENT:
    Sorry to hear that. TEACHER:

39462,"STUDENT:
    Yes! TEACHER:
    Ah, exciting!
    Ok, I thought we could practise a bit of vocabulary using some ideas from Harry Potter. In particular, personality adjectives (the adjectives that describe what kind of person someone is)
    You know how the Sorting Hat puts students into four different houses at Hogwarts?
    Can you remember what kind of students get into Gryffindor, Harry Potter's house?",,0.75141467

    Yes. I remenber that. TEACHER:

39464,"STUDENT:
    Sorry. Is it brave? TEACHER:
    Yes, that's what I am looking for!
    brave is a good adjective, or another one is 'courageous'
    brave' and 'courageous' are synonyms",0.997929743,0.224266729
39465,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    Do you know the noun for 'courageous'? The quality of being courageous

    couragement? TEACHER:
    ah, nearly
    courage",,0.948876787
39467,"STUDENT:

    clever? TEACHER:

    What about Slytherin?",,0.730851665
39471,"STUDENT:
    Sorry. I can't remember. TEACHER:
    no worries, Slytherin students are supposed to have big career goals
    they are ambitious",0.898738966,0.326458928
39472,"STUDENT:
    But may be honest?
    Oh,yes TEACHER:
    Ah, I think you're thinking about Hufflepuff where everyone is honest and nice
    Slytherin is the house of Draco Malfoy, ambitious and sometimes actually dishonest",0.988135514,0.830458016
39473,"STUDENT:
    Yes. TEACHER:
    If a person is clever and can get what they want in a dishonest way, we can call them 'cunning'",,0.675572841
39474,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    In European fairy tales, a fox is often cunning. Clever and dishonest. Is there an animal in Chinese stories that is associated with being cunning?",,0.537446068
39475,"STUDENT:
    I think you China also it's fox.
    In China TEACHER:
    Ok, fair enough! A fox it is!
    I think it's because foxes are so clever and they can steal chickens from farms, so farmers think they are cunning",0.998511757,0.994256178
39476,"STUDENT:
    Yes. In Chinese history books, there are a lot of stories about foxes. TEACHER:
    Would you say 'ambitious' is a positive or negative quality?
    Ah, interesting! I didn't know that!",0.173657458,0.997296855
39477,"STUDENT:
    I think ambitious is a negative quality in this place. TEACHER:
    I see what you mean, maybe in the context of Slytherin. But generally in English 'ambitious' is positive, actually",0.999219889,0.999494066
39478,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    If a person is ambitious, they want to achieve goals in life, maybe in their career
    And they are comfortable with becoming leaders, for example",,0.570589494
39479,"STUDENT:
    So it's a good word to describe people. TEACHER:
    Yes, I would say so!
    The noun is 'ambition', what you want to achieve
    For example, it's your ambition to become a PhD student at Fudan University, isn't it?",0.931974568,0.873331587
39480,"STUDENT:
    Yes! It's my ambition. TEACHER:
    Yes! So you're an ambitious person :)
    Ok, we've got one last house left. Hufflepuff students tend to be honest as you said and also...??",0.990977414,0.998865625
39481,"STUDENT:
    Is there a word to describe the negative means of ambition in English? TEACHER:
    Good question, let me have a think!",0.942027094,0.992371312
39482,"STUDENT:
    I'm not sure, but In China I think ambition is to describe good goals, someone is ambitious may tell a negtive quality.
    And Hufflepuff students tend to be honest and loyalty, I think. TEACHER:
    I see! I meant 'ambitious' in a very positive way when I said you were ambitious",0.996112187,0.431576422
39483,"STUDENT:
    Yes. TEACHER:
    I think 'ambitious' can be positive or negative depending on a situation",,0.682442601
39484,"STUDENT:
    Yes. TEACHER:
    For example, schools try to support girls to be more ambitious
    #ERROR!
    You can also desribe an ambitious person as 'an achiever'. Someone for whom achievement is very important
    it can sometimes be an unpleasant quality!",,0.64371814
39485,"STUDENT:
    Yes. In China there are words to describe people is positively ambitious or negtively ambitious.
    But when I translate them to English, they are both the same word 'ambitious'. TEACHER:
    Oh, I know! Someone who is ambitious in a negative way is 'vain'",0.997535372,0.998173214
39486,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    Someone who seeks status, likes to talk about themselves all the time, likes to be praised
    is vain
    Someone who places to much importance on their achievements or appearance, actually",,0.566329293
39487,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    an example from the dictionary: He was very vain about his hair and clothes
    *sorry, too much importance",,0.454925006
39488,"STUDENT:
    So vain is an always negtive word. TEACHER:
    Yes, that's right! Vain is always negative, and ambitious is quite positive",0.99911022,0.993184233
39489,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    Ok, back to Hufflepuff! Loyalty is a noun, the adjective is...? you need to lose two letters",,0.598010103
39490,"STUDENT:
    loyal TEACHER:
    Yes, cool!
    And they are also supposed to be kind-hearted
    and patient
    and the opposite of vain = humble",,0.991659897
39491,"STUDENT:
    So they are all nice people in Hufflepuff. TEACHER:
    If a person is humble, they don't like to talk about their success or achievements
    Yes, they are basically nice people in Hufflepuff, yes :)",0.999505669,0.845814736
39492,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    Which house do you think you would be sorted into? :) and I'll tell you mine",,0.741977013
39493,"STUDENT:
    I think I should be in Hufflepuff. But I like to be in Gryffindor. TEACHER:
    Oh, that's very nice! I'd love to be in Gryffindor too, but the Pottermore quiz sorted me into Ravenclaw. I'll send you a link to the quiz if you'd like, it's fun!
    Do you think courage is important then?",0.999469126,0.679383472

    why?",0.637624855,0.388664931

    We always want to do something which makes us curious, and in this case, we should have courage to try. TEACHER:
    Yes, good point! We need to be courageous to try new things!",0.998007583,
39497,"STUDENT:
    And people are always afraid of unknown things. TEACHER:
    Ok, thank you. The new words for today are courageous, courage, bright / smart, humble, kind-hearted, patient, ambitious, an achiever and vain (maybe not all of them are new). If you are learning them, could you make sure you check the pronunciation, please?
    Yes, I agree with you!",0.760941221,0.856682626

    OK thanks <STUDENT> - have you finished? Here is your paragraph - I'll give you a minute to see if you want to change anything OK? Don't worry if you can't think of anything and try not to make really big changes OK?1
    It is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality. because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent contexts. as a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.",0.99940843,0.999479803
39642,"STUDENT:
    yes, that all TEACHER:
    OK thanks hold on...
    OK thanks <STUDENT>....I get the idea of your first sentence:  “It is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality.”…...so to make this clearer in English we have a few options ok?! One choice would be to add the words 'the difference' e.g. the difference between e.g.  “It is difficult for children to tell the difference between video games and reality.” A more formal verb is ‘distinguish’ e.g. “It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality”. OR you could also say:  “It is difficult for children to realise that video games are not real.”!
    But you can't say; ...'realise between...'
    Which one do you want to choose now?",0.773237373,0.676816069
39643,"STUDENT:
    it is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. TEACHER:
    OK nice! Here's your next one coming up ...can i ask you to think about your use ofsingular and plural here please? Because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent content.
    By te way you can see I have changed contexts to 'content' - this is a good noun here ok?",0.974391922,0.999446468
39644,"STUDENT:
    okey, i saw it...I think adult is may a singular TEACHER:
    Um...'adults' is ok if you're talking about adults in general! hold on
    Your noun is 'some games' and this is fine...but what comes next? Singular or plural?",0.998304858,0.998700313
39645,"STUDENT:
    are TEACHER:
    ok good
    and the next word you have to change to the plural??
    Again it connects back to 'some games'
    a tiny little word...!
    You OK <STUDENT>?
    OK sorry - I'll help!
    you need to change 'it' to  'they'
    Oh maybe you're having internet issues?!",,0.56568285
39646,"STUDENT:
    sorry..
    so...Because some games are for adults to forget pressured and sometime it may have violent contents. TEACHER:
    OK good ...thanks <STUDENT> ...small grammar changes it's true but I want you to get into the habit of seeing these mistakes so you change them (and eventually not make them in the first place!)",0.737198974,0.992509746
39647,"STUDENT:
    yes,, I will get them into my habit,thanks TEACHER:
    Ok so your last sentence was: 'As a result of, young people really easy to copy the violence in some ways, such as teas classmates.' What does 'teas' mean here??
    Ah sorry i get it now !
    You mean the verb 'tease' right?",0.486701401,0.998131216
39648,"STUDENT:
    I think the meaning here is that fight with other students who are not strong in class. TEACHER:
    Yes ok ok ...maybe 'bully' is a good verb here - do you know that word?",0.960846022,0.955111825
39649,"STUDENT:
    no... but I study it now TEACHER:
    OK fine...yes  so e.g. 'Some children bully others.' 'Some children are bullies.' (noun for person)
    Some children are bullied at school  = passive
    And finally ....the name of the problem = bullying ....so.....bullying is a serious problem in some schools
    OK?!",0.840273985,0.888480923
39650,"STUDENT:
    yes, so...as a result bullying is a serious problem in some school TEACHER:
    Yes ok good! check for singular/plural mistakes <STUDENT> if you can please!!",0.724082208,0.999289381
39651,"STUDENT:
    schools!!
    as a result of, bullying is a serious problem in some schools. TEACHER:
    OK good wel ldone
    Ok <STUDENT> …the bit in CAPITAL letters needs changing OK? “As a result, young people REALLY EASY TO copy the violence in some ways, and bullying is a serious problem in some schools.”
    This is a structure you have used before and we need to get this right!
    If you're not sure of an idea of how to change it tell me and we'll do it together OK?",0.99949046,0.602811205
39652,"STUDENT:
    I am not sure... TEACHER:
    That's OK! Hold on...
    So for example we could use lots of possible phrases to explain the connection between seeing the violence and copying it ok?",0.867649515,0.569747081
39653,"STUDENT:
    ok' TEACHER:
    One question: If I roll two dice the chances of me getting a double six are _______? Any ideas for the adjective?
    Don't worry if not! Just tell me...
    High or low?",,0.393400334
39654,"STUDENT:
    impossible

    wow..
    it is very unlikely that you will get a double six
    sorry..... TEACHER:
    OK yes good! and the next example? That's ok!",0.718598394,0.630498106
39657,"STUDENT:
    likely TEACHER:
    OK good ...so this is one way you can explain that connection OK? INstead of using 'easy'",,0.561768963
39658,"STUDENT:
    yes,,it become more academic TEACHER:
    OK fine....<STUDENT> I'll copy the final complete paragraph and we can give it a final review tomorrow OK?  Thanks for your concentration and hard work today!

    Nice to meet you!",,0.999047767
45832,"TEACHER:
    Hi, nice to speak to you again :)
    We only really say 'nice to meet you' the first time we meet a person. After that, it's 'nice to see you' or 'nice to speak to you' (over the phone / chat, if you don't really see the person)
    Did you have a good weekend? Was there a good game on? STUDENT:
    OK. Nice to speak to you too.",0.99887285,0.993399782

    There is a coffee house. I often go to the coffee house to read books.",0.867655716,0.786278098

    Oh, sounds really nice!
    What are you reading at the moment? STUDENT:

    In China, bookshops always have a coffee house to let peple have good reading time.",0.995644663,0.987486447
45840,"TEACHER:
    I had a nice weekend. My son and I decorated a Christmas tree and watched a Christmas movie and my husband made some lovely food
    What a good idea! I've realized I probably never went to a proper bookshop like this when we lived in Shanghai, because I don't speak Chinese STUDENT:
    Sounds great!",0.99631866,0.509684785
45841,"TEACHER:
    But we enjoyed a local DVD shop there :)
    Ok, <STUDENT>, shall we have a look at B2 Writing part 2? STUDENT:
    OK.",0.78899151,0.641889203
45842,"TEACHER:
    The word count for Part 2 is the same as for Part 1 (140-190 words), but you can choose your task out of 3 options
    All tasks in part 2 are imaginary / pretend situations. For example, write an article for an English magazine or write to your English-speaking friend
    not a real magazine and not a real friend, just an imaginary situation STUDENT:
    OK.",,0.671318175
45843,"TEACHER:
    But, depending on the situation, your writing has to be a bit different. For example, if it's an email to a friend, you probably want to start with 'Hi &lt;Friend's name&gt;.'
    And end with 'Best wishes, <STUDENT>'
    or something like that
    And if it's an article, you don't have to do any of these, you basically write an essay
    Just like in Part 1, it's important to answer all the questions that the task gives you STUDENT:
    OK.",,0.597356036
45844,"TEACHER:
    Have you got that pdf with writing tasks that I sent you earlier? STUDENT:
    Yes. I'm reading the questions.",,0.93690156
45845,"TEACHER:
    Lovely!
    As you can see, the choice is a book review, an article and an informal email (to a friend) STUDENT:
    Yes. So which one is better for me.",0.948966652,0.396252885
45846,"TEACHER:
    Which one do you like best? I know you love books, but one thing to make sure of with a book review is being able to remember the name of the book, the characters and the author in English
    I think we might practise all of them, one at a time, if you'd like
    They are all very useful STUDENT:
    OK.
    I think I need some time to remember the names in the book. So the first time I think I will not choose the book review.",0.955563086,0.998870964
45847,"TEACHER:
    Ok, very wise I think!
    An article or an email then? STUDENT:
    OK.
    An article.",0.92624466,0.999479095
45848,"TEACHER:
    Ok, the most useful thing you have ever learned!
    What do you think this thing can be? STUDENT:
    Sorry. I don’t have a clear idea about this topic.
    Some characters? like honest, brave?",0.608671229,0.883620118
45849,"TEACHER:
    No worries, let me give you an example.
    No, just a useful skill you learned
    For example, when I was at school, I learned to touch type (type without looking). This is one of the most useful skills that I've learned, it has saved me so much time because I can type very fast STUDENT:
    OK, I know.",0.725946685,0.760761778
45850,"TEACHER:
    Or, when I was 4 years old, I learned to swim. It's one of the most useful things I've learned because when I fell in a pool I could swim out. Also, it means I enjoy seaside holidays
    cooking, starting a campfire, riding a bike - all useful skills
    Ok? What do you think?
    playing a musical instrument STUDENT:
    When I was at high school, I learned computer programming. This is one of the most useful skills that i've learned.",0.867306394,0.997954524
45851,"TEACHER:
    Wonderful example, yes!
    You will need to explain why it's been so useful to you STUDENT:
    It helped me go deep in computer world, and changed my life. Now I'm an engineer in a company.",0.842239057,0.858368082

    And then, in the next paragraph, answer the question, who you learned it from
    Yes, good! STUDENT:
    This place 'who' is a real person or something like a website?",0.560460324,0.553465188
45853,"TEACHER:
    a real person!
    if it was a website or school, it would be 'where did you learn it from'

    I learnt it from my old borther who was a video game developer.",0.999489632,0.989088436

    Ok, lovely. We say 'elder brother' STUDENT:
    OK.",0.896836332,0.763158114

    because what's important here is not that he might be old, but that he is older than you

    OK.",,0.537299104

    cool, is your brother still a video game developer?
    You can use the present tense if he is STUDENT:
    Yes.",,0.885327243

    I learnt it from my elder brother, who is a video game developer.

    During the progress, it showed me how to use computer codes to build a virual world. And the most important thing is that learning to coding helps me get a good job.",,0.973733372

    And also, learning to code, you need the infinitive 'to code' STUDENT:
    OK.",0.588686072,0.629657626
45862,"TEACHER:
    Some other things that might be good to write about are, how old you were when you learned to code, whether it was hard to learn, whether you liked or not
    things like that
    because you need a nice 140-190-word article :) STUDENT:
    OK.",,0.712578188
45863,"TEACHER:
    Would you like to try one more sentence? STUDENT:
    OK.
    I learnt to code when I was at high school. It was hard to start, because you need to let yourself think like a computer.

    Yeah? what did you do? I'll come back on the have done or did in a bit
    It is more common overall to use the present perfect for e.g. this morning if it hasn’t finished yet but…it’s by no means a rule and e.g.  did is perfectly fine especially if you’re focusing on the action itself
    tell me about your exercise if you like! STUDENT:
    Every morning I try to do something. This morning I went for a walk and afterwards I did some yoga at home. I'd love to run but I can't. I have something like arthrosis so if I force myself too much I get pain everywhere...",0.996154739,0.968075292

    I understand. I thought the same before I did it the first time. It is actually very hard, people tent to think that it is about relaxing and doing nothing but I think it is very good for your body.

    Yes I'm sure you're right...I have thought about doing yoga before so who knows? But i'm supposed to be doing kung fu with my daughter after Christmas! By the way <STUDENT> I noticed you've typed 'tent' a couple of time for the verb 'tend' - is that just a typo??!

    No I think you're right - I guess kids with siblings learn the hard way but for only children I think they need to lose sometimes....did you play any sport in the past? Compettive I mean

    Yeah? in the UK too I'd say....there are lots of 'park runs' everywhere every Saturday and people just turn up and do a 5k - I go to the athletics club so a bit more than average.... STUDENT:
    I think it's great! I can see much more people exercising on the streets nowadays than a few years ago",0.991655573,0.92737089

    Yes, you know one thing that I think about with running and Spain is that it  must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?)
    When I lived there I didn't do much exercise - just smoked and drank too much!
    I gave up smoking a long time ago by the way thank god... STUDENT:
    Yes, I think you are right. I'm not sure if runners keep running in summer time... I don't know if you know that in the Canary Islands it is generally 22 degrees all the year round (is it correct?) so we don't have that problem",0.984350681,0.982316127

45962,"TEACHER:
    yes I was still teaching

45963,"TEACHER:
    yes that's true! when we say them it doesn't make us think of the other meaning usually! I'd say 'fag' for 'gay' (and yes it's an insult) is more American than British STUDENT:
    I'm not sure about how to use 'look up'... Can I say 'I look up fag in the dictionary...'??",0.998654735,0.9926792

    I checked the word in the dictionary ??",0.653786569,0.997940179

    no that's good - just wanted to check - lots of non-natives use 'search' a lot now because of the internet of course  - it's fine for that but they use it too much for other things you see - look up and check = perfect STUDENT:
    OK",0.998246064,0.812093498

    Really?? For me it doesn't sound formal at all.",0.77341,0.997686759

    OK so the topic is 'Work' and question: IS job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?' STUDENT:
    I believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy, it would be difficult for you to be happy

    OK thanks <STUDENT>...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean STUDENT:
    that's the reason why after the hight school it would be better to make a councious (I know thespelling is wrong) decision
    you mean for example subject?",0.859009639,0.845897953

    OK thanks some specific examples often good idea - hold on a sec
    <STUDENT>, look at following and make a change if you can: You said: I believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you don't really enjoy...’ Are the two verb tenses OK here?  By the way: spelling = conscious and responsibility  Depend ‘from’? Lives = good for plural STUDENT:

    So now I think I understand a bit more why you feel a bit down about your English!
    You have to remember <STUDENT> that the videos on Coursera are not designed for non-natives - they would be hard for most students

    yes, it is more clearly. TEACHER:

    I have a question: in order to write number 5 I need to have read the book, is that correct? TEACHER:
    Great! The task is set for you in part 1, but you have a choice out of a few options in part 2. Could you have a quick look and tell me which one looks most appealing to you? And which one would be best to write about .in terms of showing off good language.
    Yes, that's right! In fact, not only do you need to have read the book, but you also need to have a relatively fresh memory of it, to know how to spell names of characters etc.
    Which is why the book review task is a very rare choice among candidates and exam teachers :.",0.972880938,0.941365403

    Okay! I have also noticed it is already 13:52 TEACHER:
    For example, I was doing the 'desribing the building' task with my other C2 student, and she was describing a famous museum. She went, 'It was built in 1898'. True historically, but pretty much worthless in terms of earning language proficiency points!",0.324685771,0.318213813

    a teacher, a doctor, a postman - all these people do essential jobs, they can't work from home and they keep working even during a pandemic / lockdown
    In the UK, they are called 'key workers'
    people who do very important work that keeps us all going
    Can you think of any other examples of key workers?",,
47034,"STUDENT:
    security TEACHER:
    yes, sure
    Ok! Some key workers like doctors have to work 24/7, but, of course, one person can't do it, so they take turns
    some work in the morning, some at night
    These different times when people work are called 'shifts'
    People can work a night shift (work at night)
    or work a 24-hour shift
    or work double shifts, two together
    Do you know anyone who works shifts?",,0.596225589
47035,"STUDENT:
    hm
    security ))) TEACHER:
    Yes, definitely))
    Firefighters, nursers, doctors, supermarket staff etc., right?
    Ok! And after their hard work they need to come home and start to relax
    and a good word for it is 'unwind'
    /ʌnˈwaɪnd/
    unwind after a long day
    Some people have a bath and a cup of tea to unwind
    some play some music
    I like to read a book and dance to unwind
    What about you?",0.90511268,0.654736245
47036,"STUDENT:
    I love playing Minecraft with my friend
    every Friday I play with her
    it is my way to unwind TEACHER:
    Great!

    There it is!",0.7769618,0.991083624
47037,"STUDENT:
    She is a doctor
    and her way to unwind is making music TEACHER:
    Yes, definitely!
    And it's more than just a hobby, right? She is actually super successful!",0.973888877,0.958832747
47038,"STUDENT:
    yes TEACHER:
    Do you think this story about her was recorded a long time ago? Or about now?",,0.826253578

    I think it is about now TEACHER:
    Why do you think so?",0.925321223,0.996361508

    making music it ia her hobby TEACHER:
    Ok, but why do you think the story is about now?",0.632871595,0.588518551
47041,"STUDENT:
    I think every person who is making music now , will always feel music in his or her heart TEACHER:
    Oh yes, that's true! What I was talking about is that as a doctor she talks about he coronavirus pandemic, right?
    So it's got to be 2020!",0.018275341,0.574941994
47042,"STUDENT:
    maybe the topic is that no matter who you arr and whatever your job is, you can have a hobby that doesn't depend on your job TEACHER:
    Yes, that's a good idea to take from this!",0.804709491,0.196916337

    Hi <TEACHER>
    still there?? TEACHER:
    Hi yes i'm here <STUDENT> - really sorry for delay...",0.999183249,
47048,"STUDENT:
    No worries, at the moment I have a lot of free time hehe TEACHER:
    Yes I guess so...is the 'c' word something we should mention or do you want to avoid it completely?!",0.23875231,0.907875852

    I'm ok with the 'c' word ;) TEACHER:
    OK well....can I ask - are you allowed to g o out at the moment?",0.726928734,0.999111152
47050,"STUDENT:
    How are you in England? I haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you? TEACHER:
    Yes more or less - but the current advice is to avoid social contact so things are slowing down fast...many entertainment venues are closing for example
    it's only a matter of time before more places are forced to shut down i think....",0.340015601,0.301469528
47051,"STUDENT:
    We are allowed to go out to the supermarket, pharmacy or to your work place. There is police stopping people and asking where they are going... it's very wired :( TEACHER:
    Wow yeah that's pretty heavy - as I say that's definitely on the horizon here sooner rather than later...
    although weirdly the schools are sti;l open!",0.392236539,0.677201108
47052,"STUDENT:
    I don't understand why they keep the schools open having the experiences of Italy and now Spain
    There are so many new cases every day... It's scary TEACHER:
    Yeah I think the rationale is that: Stop key workers from having childcare commitments/prevent vulnerable grandparents from being exposed through providing childcare
    Yes I guess that the vast majority of young(ish) people are relatively safe in the event of contracting the illness right...but of course it's very worrying for older people",0.271405489,0.998148146
47053,"STUDENT:
    Yes, here we had that situation at the beginning when they closed the schools but parents kept working... Now most of parents are working from home so they can look after their children and leave grandparents alone TEACHER:
    Yes I see...intersting that they expect parents to be able to look after kids AND work at the same time!
    The situation at our school is pretty catastrophic to be honest...perhaps the end!",0.999074489,0.971390195
47054,"STUDENT:
    Yessss, impossible for a lot of parents... specially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. My nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine? TEACHER:
    Yes - that's a tough change to make for everyone! I'll be in the same boat in a couple of weeks I'm sure...
    Although I'll be effectively unemployed in fact from next week probably",0.785564827,0.989503817
47055,"STUDENT:
    ohh really bad the news about your school... I guess there are not students travelling from their countries at the moment? TEACHER:
    Yes that's right and the vast majority who were here have left early while they can still get flights I'll have to scratch around getting any online work I can",0.946409888,0.6512295
47056,"STUDENT:
    It's going to be very difficult if the situation doesn't change very soon TEACHER:
    Yes, like lots of businesses the school can't survive more than a few months without income
    not with the overheads",0.873526823,0.821760877
47057,"STUDENT:
    I thought of online teaching, you can always do that. But if people can't work they don't have money to pay online classes... uffff hard TEACHER:
    so all the staff will probably be laid off
    Yes that's true I guess - that's what everyone's doing but as you say the demand won't necessarily be there right now - we'l see!
    I'm planning lots of quality time at my allotment...",0.983097353,0.900713057
47058,"STUDENT:
    That sounds like a very good plan
    Here you couldn't go to your allotment either! TEACHER:
    THat's definitely over the top! I think that would never happen in the UK!
    I've decided that allotments are quintessentially British - i.e. kind of shared/communnal but not really the perfect liberal compromise
    I mean controlled social spaces you know?",0.995534342,0.998484098
47059,"STUDENT:
    Sorry, I don't understand what you mean...
    Quintessentially?? TEACHER:
    Oh right....like the perfect example of seomthing
    as in allotments are a perfect example of Britishness
    or embody typical British values or whatever",0.752837822,0.999275378
47060,"STUDENT:
    ahh I see TEACHER:
    as in they provoke the feeling you should be sociable with your allotment 'neighbours' but there's no demand for you to be 'friends'!
    you can maintain priVACY/DISTANCE
    that's why British people like board games so much e.g. shared activity but with clear rules so that everything's under control! (maybe - just a theory - not an original one)",0.752103411,0.617580815
47061,"STUDENT:
    I understand, and I see here there are a lot of places where we could be with people keeping the 2 meters distance that doctors recommend but we can't go anywhere... same in Italy
    haha I like the board games example TEACHER:
    OK you mean (?) you should be able to go out as long as you stay 2 metres away from people
    as in: Why don't they let us?",0.990923122,0.998432109
47062,"STUDENT:
    That is what we have to do when we go to the supermarket or to the pharmacy TEACHER:
    Yes right - that must be strange - especially in Spain/Italy where you have less personal space - IN the UK 2 metres is almost normal anyway!
    There are lots of jokes in the media at the moment about that sort of thing i.e. it's the perfect excuse for BRitish people to feel less guilty about being...British! i.e. reserved etc",0.184423706,0.623059094
47063,"STUDENT:
    But for example, there is a big avenue in front of my house where I could walk without getting too close to people but there is a police officer walking around (not all the time) asking people where they are going... If you go to the supermarket they ask you for the receipt... It's crazy! I go to the supermarket everyday to buy something so that I have some fresh air at list for half an hour TEACHER:
    Wow - so if you live in a flat (do you?) you basically can't be outside at all really?",0.930399934,0.673049784
47064,"STUDENT:
    Here there are soooo many jokes about everything... It's great because at least we laugh quite often... TEACHER:
    Yes you've got to laugh or...(you know the ending right?)",0.940311454,0.221745253
47065,"STUDENT:
    yes!!! I'm not suppose to leave at all. I'm very lucky, I can see the sea from my sofa and I live alone but I'm very sorry for families who live in a small flat with little children
    Noooo, I don't know the ending! please, tell me... TEACHER:
    ..or you'd cry! Not really funny or clever - just wondered if you knew! Often we don't bother saying the second part like lots of idioms...
    Yes really tough as you say for people with toddlers etc I live in the middle of nowhere so I guess nobody can stop me from going for a walk where I am....",0.798430812,0.999254279
47066,"STUDENT:
    haha we have something similar! 'Me río por no llorar' TEACHER:
    OK nice - thanks! Exactly the same really...",0.914128112,0.518549506
47067,"STUDENT:
    You are very lucky there in the middle of nowhere TEACHER:
    ya gotta laugh' is if you can imagine the quick spoken form of the phrase...
    Hey <STUDENT> do you read phonemic script by the way?
    As in you'd follow this right?: /jəgɒ(t)əlɑːf/",0.689072203,0.667339677
47068,"STUDENT:
    What is being very nice is that there are a lot of free stuff available online, specially on Instagram. There are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, yoga classes... Everything to keep us doing something!! I have a diary to be able to remember all the activities I'd like to do ;)
    Sorry, I go back to your question TEACHER:
    Yes that's great - I guess we're luck to have the internet these days in this situation ...ok I'll wait..",0.956739446,0.637045355
47069,"STUDENT:
    I don't know all the symbols but I recognise a lot of them
    Every time I check a word in the dictionary (very often) I have a look at the phonemic script TEACHER:
    OK I understand - well, can be useful I think - once you get used to it it's very quick - that's great you check in the dictionary",0.997791052,0.872975696
47070,"STUDENT:
    Wait, do you check words in the dictionary?? or look up? TEACHER:
    the more i teach the more I focus on pronunciation to b ehonest
    you can say check or look up - both fine (and common)
    I guess 'chec' could imply you kinda know a bit already and 'look up' can suggest you know nothing you see?
    check' I mean
    A new phrasal verb by the way used by young people (but not by me) = 'search up'
    As in: I'll search it up on my phone' - sounds horrible to me but lots of kids are saying that now!",0.998973833,0.998991785
47071,"STUDENT:
    I think it's very important (pronunciation). I always check it when I have doubts because it's been difficult for me to make people understand me sometimes when I lived in England... Since I spend some time there the first time I went, I realised how important it is to know the correct pronunciation of words...
    I won't use search up then ;) TEACHER:
    Yes I think that's great you focused on that - I remember the small amount of time I heard you speaking you seemd to have very good pronunciation (especailly for a Spanish speaker - sorry that sounds like a back-handed compliment)",0.990996037,0.999154552
47072,"STUDENT:
    ohh thank you! I try hard :)
    What does back-handed compliment mean??ç TEACHER:
    Um...a compliment that could be understood as an insult",0.997793604,0.998457995
47073,"STUDENT:
    hahah TEACHER:
    As in your pronuncation is good but only compared with other Spanish speakers who are generally terrible (and no I don't mean that entirely)
    ..but many Spaniards do need to focus more on pronunciation of course!",,0.658787384
47074,"STUDENT:
    I understand what you mean now TEACHER:
    It can be very frustrating if you don't do it fairly early on..",0.591997094,0.75191292
47075,"STUDENT:
    I think it's our teachers fault (teachers here). They don't care too much about it, here grammar seems to be veryyy important TEACHER:
    Yes I'm sure you're right - I guess it'll change with the exposure to authentic speech on the internet etc
    it's definitely changed already in my expereince
    the average pronunciation of my younger students is better than 10 years ago for example
    cos they watch Netflix all the time...
    or youtube or whatever",0.983568501,0.838166604
47076,"STUDENT:
    Yes, that's terrible. Every time I try to record a whatsapp message in English my phone doens't get a word :(. When I do it in Spanish it works perfectly... TEACHER:
    Oh really? Its not because it's on the 'Spanish' setting is it? I'm sure you 're good enough to get a device to understand you no?",0.994709455,0.888065781

    Yes yes I know",0.899827325,0.775237822
47078,"STUDENT:
    Nooo, in English, I change the language when I want to do it in English TEACHER:
    Hey <STUDENT> did you notice my Spanish intefernce just not - seriously, when I put 'no' at the end of my sentence - that's not normal - it something i  retained from speaking Spanish years ago...
    cos it's more efficient",0.920013459,0.576586899
47079,"STUDENT:
    haha no, I haven't realised until now that you said it. It's true that 'no' it's much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc TEACHER:
    yes you know that in 50 years linguists predict that we will all say just 'innit?' in English (which currently is associated with lower class speakers)
    I say it for 'isn't it?' which is a little bit lower class (!) but some poeple say it for all question tags (which is definitely more frowned upon by snobs)",0.848078546,0.950695723

    I'd be very happy to take that lower class speakers habit!! ;) TEACHER:
    Yes you'll be fine in 50 years!

    It feels very artificial for me to use the question tags, when I use them I feel very posh haha

    Both topics were usual ones, but I couldn't find enough synonyms.

    Yes, this is the right approach!
    What about 44 and 53? Are you not sure which one fits better? STUDENT:

    what about 53? why did you choose A? STUDENT:
    I was going to answer with the sentence: ' the photographic medium has provided one of the most important and influential means of capturing the essence of our being alive.' but this justifies 52 A...

    Great! The task is set for you in part 1, but you have a choice out of a few options in part 2. Could you have a quick look and tell me which one looks most appealing to you? And which one would be best to write about .in terms of showing off good language.
    Yes, that's right! In fact, not only do you need to have read the book, but you also need to have a relatively fresh memory of it, to know how to spell names of characters etc.
    Which is why the book review task is a very rare choice among candidates and exam teachers :. STUDENT:
    Therefore number 5 is out of question in this case .I actually have the book 'Girl With a Pearl Earring', but in the last years I am piling up some books because I have less time to read....",0.972880938,0.993157174

    I haven't read either of them, unfortunately

    I'll just say here that you can pick an imaginary as well as a real situation in your life. Some people find it easier to write about imaginary situations, and vice versa STUDENT:

    Yes, you know one thing that I think about with running and Spain is that it  must be really hot for some of the year - as in too hot to run(?)

    Yes, I think you are right. I'm not sure if runners keep running in summer time... I don't know if you know that in the Canary Islands it is generally 22 degrees all the year round (is it correct?) so we don't have that problem TEACHER:

    So now I think I understand a bit more why you feel a bit down about your English!
    You have to remember <STUDENT> that the videos on Coursera are not designed for non-natives - they would be hard for most students

53369,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    The word count for Part 2 is the same as for Part 1 (140-190 words), but you can choose your task out of 3 options
    All tasks in part 2 are imaginary / pretend situations. For example, write an article for an English magazine or write to your English-speaking friend
    not a real magazine and not a real friend, just an imaginary situation",,0.641889203
53370,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    But, depending on the situation, your writing has to be a bit different. For example, if it's an email to a friend, you probably want to start with 'Hi &lt;Friend's name&gt;.'
    And end with 'Best wishes, <STUDENT>'
    or something like that
    And if it's an article, you don't have to do any of these, you basically write an essay
    Just like in Part 1, it's important to answer all the questions that the task gives you",,0.671318175

53373,"STUDENT:
    Yes. So which one is better for me. TEACHER:
    Which one do you like best? I know you love books, but one thing to make sure of with a book review is being able to remember the name of the book, the characters and the author in English
    I think we might practise all of them, one at a time, if you'd like
    They are all very useful",0.955563086,0.396252885
53374,"STUDENT:
    OK.
    I think I need some time to remember the names in the book. So the first time I think I will not choose the book review. TEACHER:
    Ok, very wise I think!
    An article or an email then?",0.92624466,0.998870964

    Sorry. I don’t have a clear idea about this topic.
    Some characters? like honest, brave? TEACHER:
    No worries, let me give you an example.
    No, just a useful skill you learned

    OK, I know. TEACHER:
    Or, when I was 4 years old, I learned to swim. It's one of the most useful things I've learned because when I fell in a pool I could swim out. Also, it means I enjoy seaside holidays
    cooking, starting a campfire, riding a bike - all useful skills

    During the progress, it showed me how to use computer codes to build a virual world. And the most important thing is that learning to coding helps me get a good job. TEACHER:

    Maybe, my brother showed me...?",0.954496508,0.973733372

53389,"STUDENT:
    OK. TEACHER:
    Some other things that might be good to write about are, how old you were when you learned to code, whether it was hard to learn, whether you liked or not
    things like that
    because you need a nice 140-190-word article :)",,0.629657626

    Would you like to try one more sentence?",,0.712578188
53391,"STUDENT:
    OK.
    I learnt to code when I was at high school. It was hard to start, because you need to let yourself think like a computer. But when my elder brother taught me how to use computer language to build a tiny game, I thought I really like these things, and i would be a coder in the future. TEACHER:
    This is excellent work, <STUDENT>!",0.286699393,0.145877455

    OK thanks <STUDENT>...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean",0.859009639,0.998631605

    that's the reason why after the hight school it would be better to make a councious (I know thespelling is wrong) decision

    Have you seen lego chess?

    to resign means to leave your job. For example, you go to your boss and say, 'I resign'

    because they're not pleased with the job he is doing
    Ministers and other government officials can resign STUDENT:

    In English, some houses are marketed as 'retirement property'. People don't have to live near work anymore, they can live somewhere nice or maybe in a neighbourhood with other retired people
    Yes, I was thinking that, it's Lego, so it would break when you play it. Have you got it? Do you play with <STUDENT'S HUSBAND>?
    Yes, I know Frozen! STUDENT:
    So when she is playing with it the construction is broking?

    Good, thank you! How about you?",0.995187625,0.854385131
56366,"TEACHER:
    All good, thank you!
    Thanks for your essay, I really enjoyed reading it! Some very nice language there :)
    I especially liked the inverted third conditional :)
    Had it not been for this shared trove of knowledge and rules, it would have been impossible to build today’s nations where millions of people, who are de facto strangers to each other, live and thrive together.
    I mean this one
    Also, it's an elegant summary of the two viewpoints, very nice STUDENT:
    Thank you :) As I explained: it took me a while to write it, but I thought that sometimes trying to perfect one's language can be a good exercise :)",0.831074426,0.884872763
56367,"TEACHER:
    Yes, absolutely. If you were in a situation where you have to observe the time limit such as an exam, I'd suggest sticking to a very clear structure with topic sentences, It does speed up the process! (I would say the structure is very clear in the last two paragraphs, but the beginning is more free-flowing) STUDENT:
    Maybe I should start by writing a topic sentence for each paragraph ;) It took me a long time to write it for multiple reasons, among them the fact that I rewrote someparts...
    *some parts",0.797811747,0.994878909
56368,"TEACHER:
    Yes, a boring but reliable structure. 1. Introduction (signposting early what you're going to write about) 2. topic sentence, expansion 3. topic sentence, expansion
    or maybe 4 too, I'm not saying there should be 3 paragraphs :) STUDENT:
    Yes, of course :) The problem is that it is difficult to be 'creative' with such a structure...
    since it is a topic that I'm interested in I had plenty to write about in 'my way'...but, of course, for an exam it's better to choose some topics
    and produce just what you're asked for :)",0.994566433,0.992277778
56369,"TEACHER:
    Yes! But it's also difficult to steer away from the topic and get lost, which is a problem with a lot of exam writing (not yours, actually)
    Yep, that's the trick!
    It is an interesting topic though, isn't it? And the one that's existed since the dawn of time as your video so nicely illustrates :) STUDENT:
    Yes, it is quite interesting, especially as a parent...and I think that it is becoming more and more apparent, as society changes with greater speeds...",0.997798439,0.960961735
56370,"TEACHER:
    Yes, I'm sure our kids' generation will find ways to shock us even though we might be thinking now that we've seen it all STUDENT:
    If I think about the first time I surfed the internet, I was one of the first in my little town...and now, if we have a problem, that's 'too much' internet...
    Haha, indeed...we'll have to wait and see what they come up with",0.935688533,0.335371073

    Anyway, for our final lesson, have you maybe got any questions / anything you'd like to discuss / anything I can help with? STUDENT:
    Hmm...no, not really...

    I see, oh it's really good, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! STUDENT:

56374,"TEACHER:
    Yes, I do have something prepared, we'll get to it in a second, just wanted to check with you first
    You probably do it anyway, but I do recommend reading good quality media in English, I do believe it helps with the language a lot!
    I know I've become a better writer because I do like my Guardian articles :)
    What do you prefer to read in English? STUDENT:
    I read mostly books...from biographies, to science and technology related treaties...
    Sometimes I skim through bbc or cnn, but I find it hard to read with a attention a whole article on my mobile phone...
    Oh, I also read a lot of scientific articles on machine learning, but the quality of the language there is mixed...",0.780039518,0.996539185
56375,"TEACHER:
    Right, sure, the quality of the language is not the main point there I can imagine
    I think an opinion article is as close as it gets 'in real life' to those exam essays, and they're usually full of good language STUDENT:
    It should be of some concern...but currently the pace at which articles in ML (machine learning) is out of control...which leads to lower quality in many aspects (including language)
    Indeed...they also have the advantage of being 'short': I am used to long texts, but in real life you often need to be synthetic",0.999281654,0.993167274
56376,"TEACHER:
    Interesting! You're in a very dynamic field
    Yes, absolutely, they are quite concise and pack a lot in a small space
    Anyway, a little something I've prepared for you to practice those past conditionals (if you have the book handy, feel free to open this chapter, the one we were working on last time)
    I'm going to tell you a story and invite you to speculate about what could have happened if people had acted differently :) STUDENT:
    I would dare to say that, to a point, it is a fad...a lot of people have been blinded by the promises of artificial intelligence, money is flowing and people are trying to apply it to everything...still it is very interesting and dynamic, indeed!
    Okay! I have the book here, but I don't remember the page...",0.907958005,0.991513587
56377,"TEACHER:
    One second, I'll find it
    A fad? Very interesting, coming from you! As I said before, my main objection from the user side of it is 'artificial empathy'. It just doesn't work in my opinion!
    It's page 88 in the actual book and page 89 in the pdf
    Ok, the story! STUDENT:
    Haha...not in all aspects, but in some, for instance empathy...or creating an artificial psychiatrist ;) Yes, the story!
    Are you still here?",0.998891535,0.995475548
56378,"TEACHER:
    It's about a poor musician called Anton who lived in a small fishing village. He and the daughter of a rich fisherman, Barbara, were in love, and he went to her father to ask for her hand. The father said that he had to have a boat to be able to marry his daughter and provide for her. But Anton did not have a boat, only his guitar! Anton went to his friend Chris, a fisherman, and asked to borrow his boat. But Chris refused him saying that he needed the boat for work. Barbara and Anton broked up. Heartbroken, Anton proposed to another girl, Elizabeth, but Elizabeth said he was still in love with Barbara and turned him down. Anton was unhappy and unmarried then. But who was to blame?
    Sorry, still here, but a long story!
    in third conditional sentences, please :) STUDENT:

    If Barbara's father had grew up in another time he would have been more open-minded and let Barbara choose who to marry.",0.999469063,0.921383467

    lend (lent, lent) = let someone temporarily have something that belongs to you
    borrow: borrow some money from a bank, borrow a book from the library, May I borrow your pen, please?
    And which of them is a synonym of 'loan'? STUDENT:
    I see :) The difference is between the fact that you are actively 'giving' something or 'taking' something...
    A loan is something you ask to the bank, so I'd go for 'borrow'...
    But I didn't know load is a verb too",0.44010848,0.99873206
56384,"TEACHER:
    Yes! Like in Italian, it's the same verb in my native language, so I could recognize the problem :) But there's a very clear distinction in English. Also, you don't use 'have' instead of 'borrow'
    There's a big difference between 'you can have it' and 'you can borrow it'!
    If you say 'you can have it', you don't expect 'it' back! STUDENT:
    That's quite clear to me",0.997263463,0.800254377
56385,"TEACHER:
    Ok, sure!
    to take out a loan / apply for a bank loan means to borrow money from a bank or to try to do so STUDENT:
    Haha I know :) Unless you say something like 'you can have it for a couple of days, but I need it this Sunday'",0.526065596,0.163781082
56386,"TEACHER:
    But 'to loan' means 'to lend' STUDENT:
    (I hope I'm not making up an expression) Oh...okay",0.872616181,0.636697033
56387,"TEACHER:
    Banks loan money
    Yes, exactly, it would be clearer to say 'you can borrow it for a couple of days!' STUDENT:
    So my reasoning was wrong...ok...I guess it is more formal
    I mean loan is used in more formal situations, right?",0.102827934,0.994129084
56388,"TEACHER:
    Ooh, we're out of time! STUDENT:
    Or maybe with money/institutions?",0.117431078,0.425052365
56389,"TEACHER:
    Yes, absolutely! STUDENT:
    13:59 on my laptop",0.559211353,0.811699171

    Loan is more formal!

    Hi! I am good thank you :) It was great! A bit tiring though: we met with a lot of relatives...

56394,"TEACHER:
    Sounds lovely!
    Well, I had my first dose a week ago, so yay!
    of the covid vaccine I mean STUDENT:
    Of course...Austria just sent the appointments to everyone who asked for the vaccine: I am getting my first dose in a month :)",0.021199126,0.998630128
56395,"TEACHER:
    Otherwise, we keep waiting for some sun, maybe we'll finally glimpse it this weekend
    Yay! A wait, but at least you have a date I suppose STUDENT:
    That's true! The weather was terrible in Italy too...we had only two days without rain",0.277431542,0.920038764
56396,"TEACHER:
    Really? Well, if even Italy is all rainy, it kind of makes me feel a bit better :) STUDENT:
    Haha...in Italy we have a saying 'mal comune, mezzo gaudio' (a common pain is half a joy)",0.995496719,0.943224727
56397,"TEACHER:
    Haha, exactly! :)
    I wonder what the saying is in English, there should be something... STUDENT:
    But I didn't have time for the writing, sorry...we really travelled a lot!
    miserly loves company...maybe
    (I found it with google, I didn't know it)",0.984390539,0.813677831

    No worries! I'm taking the next week off teaching because my son will be on holiday, so if you still want to do it, you'll have some extra time STUDENT:
    That's great! Agreed!",0.827328809,0.270532327
56399,"TEACHER:
    Yes, kind of 'misery loves company', hmmm
    But the Italian one is more joyful! STUDENT:
    Yes, at least it mentions something that isn't misery..",0.534323167,0.987197429
56400,"TEACHER:
    Lovely! Also, I am sad to say that we will be closing the teaching project on June 18, which means that we will only have the time for two classes, between June 7 and June 18 STUDENT:
    I see :) Okay, well it was a nice opportunity so I can only be thankful abou it
    And I am curious to see what sort of reserach they do on the papers: I'll follow the professor who I first contacted for this opportunity ;)",0.759219891,0.640416942

    Yes, it's been a pleasure on my part, and of course, we are very grateful to our volunteer students like yourself STUDENT:

    I think they're taking the research in more than one direction at the moment. Yes, I'm sure you can contact <RESEARCHER> for more information if you're curious, he did mention it STUDENT:
    Cool, thank you :) It would be cool if I eventually end up working also on the data I contributed to generate...",0.121921696,0.811320907
56403,"TEACHER:
    Ok, so the question is, what would you like to focus on in our remaining time? I've been planning to look at some more speaking questions from C2 proficiency today STUDENT:
    (If they release it openly)
    Okay, let's look at speaking questions!",0.747717475,0.991453407
56404,"TEACHER:
    Yes, <RESEARCHER> would be a better person to speak to about this than myself!
    It would be cool if I eventually end up working also on the data I contributed to generate
    I feel that 'also' is a bit out of place here. What would be a better place for it? STUDENT:
    Oh, the also is in the wrong position there, right?
    Yep",0.902480674,0.254308115
56405,"TEACHER:
    haha, yes! You see it yourself, don't you? STUDENT:
    I could either remove it, or...maybe...I could put it before 'working': end up also working ...",0.357123991,0.317062361
56406,"TEACHER:
    Yes! I like it before 'working'. STUDENT:
    Yes and no...but now, everytime I write it an alarm bel rings in my head so I try to pay more attention (not in that case, apparently)",0.999366454,0.550672216
56407,"TEACHER:
    also working' - like other researchers
    It's German interference, isn't it? I can just hear 'arbeiten auch' in my mind STUDENT:
    Yes...moreover German has an interjection which is written 'also', has a slightly different sound...
    The way we use 'anche' in Italian, which is the closes word to 'also' we have, is also different...",0.738758621,0.989123504
56408,"TEACHER:
    Aah, yes, I remember! indeed STUDENT:
    So it is really tricky for me ;)",0.589397718,0.897125515
56409,"TEACHER:
    I can imagine! STUDENT:
    *the closest
    Anyway, practise makes perfect :) As you see if I think about it I am starting to correct it!",0.884917222,0.486648402
56410,"TEACHER:
    Ok, C2 questions! I think I mentioned last time that there are several parts to the speaking test, and in the first part the questions are focused on you rather than abstract
    I'm warning you, some of them are a bit weird, you'll have to just roll with them and show off your English! STUDENT:
    Okay, that's fine!",0.384319089,0.718046668
56411,"TEACHER:
    You'll see what I mean (I'll start with not so weird ones though)
    The test always begins with, please tell us your name, are you a student or do you work and then maybe 'where are you from', no need to answer those now
    Next question: You said you are from Friulli (did I get that right??) Is that an interesting place to live? STUDENT:
    Those are the easy ones..
    Yes, I am originally from Friuli (just one 'l').",0.684480917,0.998264003
56412,"TEACHER:
    yep, they give the examiner a chance to fill in the papers :)
    Sorry! Friuli STUDENT:
    It depends on what you mean by 'interesting'. It is a small, rural region which was among the poorest in Italy before the so called Italian economic miracle of the sixties...",0.989455677,0.413371448
56413,"TEACHER:
    Ok, lovely! Feel free to add another sentence or two STUDENT:
    I find it interesting because you can experience nature in all its forms: from mountains, to the sea side...and, as any place in Italy, it has many places that are interesting as far as history is concerned. For instance Trieste, with castle Miramare, or Palmanova: a small city which still has the original footprint from the middle ages
    and looks like a star, surrounded by its wals, when you look at it from a map.
    In this sense it is quite interesting :) But I would use the word quiet to describe it: if you look for a thrilling night life you should look somewhere else.",0.659378639,0.565996152
56414,"TEACHER:
    Ok, thanks! Great sophisticated grammar, I like it! It would be helpful to use some synonyms to 'interesting' though, such as... STUDENT:
    (maybe when you see an aerial view would be a better way to say 'look from a map')",0.966984958,0.775093209
56415,"TEACHER:
    what comes to your mind?
    Yes, sure, because you mean 'look at its map', but an aerial view is a better expression! STUDENT:
    Oh..I didn't think about synonyms...this is a trick I should remember...
    To be honest I don't have many synonyms...maybe stimulating, in certain contexts?
    noteworthy",0.999507933,0.090585889
56416,"TEACHER:
    Yes, you would probably use 'interesting' in real life, and so would a native speaker, but you aren't scoring any points with it in the test as you can imagine! STUDENT:
    Okay! But I should probably exercise with synonyms because it isn't that easy (even when looking at italian synonyms for help ;) )",0.905428735,0.90686091
56417,"TEACHER:
    I find it interesting... could be replaced with something like 'it appeals to me'
    noteworthy is a good one! and then all kind of descriptive adjectives, like 'fascinating' etc.
    There is a lot unpack / explore in terms of history etc. STUDENT:
    Indeed...I should exercise by paraphrasing questions",0.882124008,0.731104075
56418,"TEACHER:
    Ok, let's try another one! STUDENT:
    into ones that use more refined terms.",0.651760995,0.766743377
56419,"TEACHER:
    exactly, with that in mind
    How good are you at organising your time? STUDENT:

    Excellent! great paraphrasing STUDENT:
    Therefore I'd answer saying I am good at planning my day, even when this means handling unexpected events.
    Which are common among parents of small children.",0.761568473,0.912586548

    Lovely! A good expression: firefighting (especially in the work context)
    dealing with problems that pop up unexpectedly
    Too much time is spent firefighting rather than moving the business forward.
    an example from the dictionary STUDENT:
    Oh, that's a lovely expression!
    And I am not sure I've ever encountered it...I'll write it down :)",0.762899396,0.994309824
56422,"TEACHER:
    Yes, very useful! My husband says it all the time, when he's annoyed that he hasn't made any progress because he's been firefighting the minor crises
    Ok, the next one!
    What would you dream job be? (they are eliciting conditionals and the grammar of speculations like could / might  here!) STUDENT:
    If I had the possibility to go back in time, I would try to focus my efforts into becoming a pilot with the final objective of becoming an astronaut.
    I might have actually attempted to follow this passion of mine if it was not for my parents who are scared of flying...
    and made it very clear that, if I was to flight, they would be in a constant state of alert and fear.
    (okay, I exaggerated a bit, but it was just to show off some language)",0.401344507,0.533327442
56423,"TEACHER:
    Excellent!
    Just one objection. Third conditional: I might have attempted, it it ___ ___ ___ for my parents (because it's in past)
    *in the past STUDENT:
    if it were not for my parents?",0.964258656,0.996747238
56424,"TEACHER:
    if it had not been!
    The pure third conditional is 'past perfect, if would / might / could have V3' STUDENT:
    okay..I guess I'll have to check it again..",0.979896421,0.429579245
56425,"TEACHER:
    I'll make a note, if we've got some time left, we can do a bit of third conditional practice in June
    But otherwise great!
    Ok, are you ready for the weird one?
    How important is the internet for you? STUDENT:
    I must say I was expecting a weirder question...",0.757382583,0.974555106

    Really? I've got to up my game :) I thought this was weird! STUDENT:

    The best answer to this would be, 'Excuse me, inte... what?'

    I can hardly move a stone without connecting to some server to check how many steps I've taken today or using a neural network to try an identify the species of the insect that is strolling through my porch...

56429,"TEACHER:
    Love the vocabulary! brilliant!
    And you managed to avoid using the word 'important')) STUDENT:
    I was joking ;) Thank you! I must say that I should exercise a bit, as currently my words are stirred more by the will to produce outstanding English rather than saying what I mean to say haha
    But, as you said, the examiners don't know anything about me, they are there only to evaluate my English",0.492210276,0.947948007

    Yes, sure. Are there recycling bins in Ukraine now? I haven't been there for about 4 years now! STUDENT:

    Hi <STUDENT>!
    How's it going? STUDENT:
    Everything good thank you :) How about you?",,0.748656688
56959,"TEACHER:
    Good, thank you! The lockdown's been getting to me this week though... STUDENT:
    Oh, I am sorry about that...do you know how long will it last?",0.926140531,0.851903388
56960,"TEACHER:
    Well, schools are re-opening next Monday, which is some normality I suppose. And I'll be able to see other people at pick-up and drop-off!
    We bought a new car a few weeks ago, but we aren't allowed to go anywhere until March 29
    Which is going to be the second phase of unlocking STUDENT:
    Well, school is a start..to think that now we are counting on the opportunity to see other parents when bringing children to school...",0.970612781,0.84975775
56961,"TEACHER:
    I know, goodness! Just to see other human beings! STUDENT:
    I see...here things are more relaxed now, but you need to do a quick test for almost everything...for istance, if I want to go to the office, I have to test every second day.",0.968778521,0.333542061
56962,"TEACHER:
    I'm very lucky to be locked down with a family, of course. I can't imagine what it's like for single people! STUDENT:
    I agree on that one..sometimes I wish for some silence but, to be honest, I believe people living alonge have it much harder...",0.35755444,0.858674149
56963,"TEACHER:
    Hmm, interesting! The country must be well stocked up on instant tests
    Have you been going to the office?
    Yes, you seem way ahead in terms of being out of lockdown! They haven't even offered a timeframe on the return to offices here STUDENT:
    Yes, they are aiming at doing 3 million per week or so, in a country with something like 8.5 million inhabitants.",0.333788218,0.717778515
56964,"TEACHER:
    Is that all? I thought Austria had a bigger population!
    There are about 66 million in the UK STUDENT:
    So far I didn't go: it has opened starting today, but I couldn't get the test done...my wife had the astrazeneca vaccine and suffered from a bad fever as a side effect...
    so the last three days were intense ;)",0.971957556,0.094383795

    Oh I see, sorry to hear that!! Hope she'll feel better very soon! STUDENT:
    Today she is better, in fact she is currently out with the children...some silence, finally ;)
    Yes, Austria is small..especially when you think that Wien and its surroundings count 2.5 million inhabitants...",0.868906084,0.991775651
56966,"TEACHER:
    Interesting! English people spell it 'Vienna' STUDENT:
    You are right, also Italian people do...and also Austrian actually...
    I don't know why I went for the German spelling...",0.996439578,0.999112377

    Anyway, the vaccine is a milestone even if it comes at a cost, congratulations to your wife! STUDENT:
    Thanks :)",0.112617516,0.920050822
56968,"TEACHER:
    The Austrians spell it differently from the Germans? I didn't know that either STUDENT:
    One thing that I can't really understand is that in Italy they consider University staff as high priority, so a lot of my ex-collegues have been vaccinated...even though they are working remotely most of the time and barely see anyone
    The official German is Wien, I believe...but Austrian tend to have also 'their' version of some words...
    And I have heard them say Vienna..",0.433696975,0.998368941
56969,"TEACHER:
    Ah, they've adopted the occupation-based approach then. It's strictly age-based in the UK, the only exception being people with medical conditions that make them more vulnerable STUDENT:
    Yes, but currently they are vaccinating people over 80, medical stuff...and then, before school teachers (who see their pupils at school) they went for University staff...",0.807500536,0.984434142
56970,"TEACHER:
    I've been thinking about you saying 'silence', as in a break from the kids. I would use 'quiet' instead. Or 'peace and quiet' STUDENT:
    I don't really understand the ratio...but then, there is little I can do, I only hope that things will speed up :)
    Oh, okay...I guess silence is more of a literary word?",0.493341488,0.983084226
56971,"TEACHER:
    Oh, now that I'm thinking about it, they vaccinated medical professionals in the first group as well. But school teachers, police etc. don't get a priority, a decision that meets with a lot of criticism
    Silence and quiet (as a noun) are very close, but silence is about the act of not uttering a sound while quiet is about the enjoyable perception of the lack of loud noises
    If it makes any sense STUDENT:
    It does..I had never appreciated the difference, thank you for the description!
    So it would be 'I remained silent/in silence' vs 'The house is quiet'",0.991655577,0.994903567
56972,"TEACHER:
    I just feel it would be more 'English' to say, ah, some peace and quiet at last! (kids are in bed or something like that)
    Yes, exactly!
    Your examples are spot-on STUDENT:
    That was just a simple example...but thank you!",0.985254378,0.893285823
56973,"TEACHER:
    Great, shall we go to the last exercise in the Use of English part of the test? And then I've prepared a bit of linguistic deliciousness for you :) STUDENT:
    Yes! Let me find the file",0.727337252,0.71281979
56974,"TEACHER:
    Please, it's page 6 in the pdf STUDENT:
    Part 4, found it!",0.701810674,0.633226196
56975,"TEACHER:
    Lovely! Key word tranformation, probably the trickiest 'use of English' task.
    which is reflected in the fact that each sentence gets two points, not one, like in the previous tasks
    I mean when it's being marked STUDENT:
    I see...let's try
    25. no telling
    25. no telling how long",0.76379542,0.035601217
56976,"TEACHER:
    You can use 3-8 words for the gap, and the challenge is to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible STUDENT:
    nope...I have to think a bit longer for these indeed...
    25. no telling how long it",0.246192016,0.040377852
56977,"TEACHER:
    Yes, correct! the last option STUDENT:
    26. is little demand for",0.146115392,0.415025127
56978,"TEACHER:
    yes, good! STUDENT:
    27. impressed by how good great a (I am not 100% sure about the preprositions 'by' here)
    28. resignation came as a surprise to
    (29 later)
    30. the height of his power",0.503038279,0.832257057
56979,"TEACHER:
    Hold on, 27. The preposition is good! Also with / at are possible. But 'good' doesn't quite convey the meaning, the answer is 'skilled' or 'skillful' STUDENT:
    Interesting...actually I work also on paraphrase problem",0.987760111,0.663629761
56980,"TEACHER:
    28 = correct STUDENT:
    and changing 'skill' with 'good' is the sort of mistake I expect from my models...I should have read the sentence twice! Thank you for pointing it out
    29. was not a tree whatsoever in
    I am really not sure about 29, I am wondering if I should keep the word 'vegetation'",0.338540889,0.93031154
56981,"TEACHER:
    Yes, this task is different from others, in that paraphrasing is actually discouraged
    Exactly, good idea!
    there was no vegetation whatsoever in/ there was nothing whatsoever growing in
    because there could have been a bush / flower, not necessarily a tree
    And the same issue in 30. How would you change your answer to keep the meaning as close to the original as possible? STUDENT:
    I see...I was thinking that 'a tree whatsoever' would convey the meaning of 'a tree or anything similar'...but maybe my understanding of the word whatsoever isn't correct.
    At the height of his success,
    Where I am not sure how you spell 'success'...anyway",0.998080872,0.998586517
56982,"TEACHER:
    Oh no, whatsoever just means 'absolutely none', it's a way of amplifying 'no'. He has no money/ friends whatsoever.
    Yes, at the height of his success! STUDENT:
    OKay :) it was difficult indeed...and, at least from this first attempt, I'd say keeping the meaning 'as close as possible' is part of the problem.
    is the most difficult part of the problem.",0.999391331,0.794648351
56983,"TEACHER:
    Oh, exactly, and you got all the expressions they are looking for right, I think
    It's about learning the logic of the task
    In writing and speaking, the situation is reverse. You are expected to paraphrase, especially at this level of proficiency
    For example, if the examiner asks you, 'Do you prefer to spend time on your own or with friends?' in a speaking test, STUDENT:
    Which means I should definitely prepare for the exam, it shouldn't be too difficult.",0.691049033,0.940212717
56984,"TEACHER:
    it would be a bit of a waste of opportunity to start saying, 'I prefer to spend my time with friends...' because you've just repeated the question and haven't shown off your English
    When you could have said, 'I'm quite gregarious, and I'm most in my element among people' STUDENT:
    I see...",0.835178328,0.692662298
56985,"TEACHER:
    But in key word transformation, only the necessary paraphrasing! STUDENT:
    Okay! It is so difficult for me to talk about my free time
    I mean, in the current situation...",0.820618686,0.551885437
56986,"TEACHER:
    Haha, yes, I can imagine! It's just an example STUDENT:
    I enjoy both company and solitude, even though I would normally tend towards the latter. I enjoy studying and learning.
    But now I have children and I am under a light lockdown, so I am always with my children...",0.853557063,0.692549649
56987,"TEACHER:
    But again, the skill for the speaking task is to talk at length in a way that shows off your language on any topic. The good news is, you don't ever have to be truthful, just whatever gives your English a chance to shine!
    For example, I wouldn't really describe myself as gregarious, but it was the first C2 word that came to my mind, and I went with it STUDENT:
    Haha, I know...this reminds me of Hugh Laurie, when he auditioned for Dr House he lied about where he was staying, because he felt like 'Chicago' was too difficult to say with an american accent (I believe it was Chicago)
    I see...well, if latin words are a plus, it shouldn't be difficult for me...",0.64369986,0.950269451
56988,"TEACHER:
    Oh really? Love it! (and love Hugh Laurie, one of my favourite actors) STUDENT:
    Yes...it was one of his interviews, but finding it now would be like looking for the needle in a haystack",0.989252957,0.633161989
56989,"TEACHER:
    Ah, speaking of words!
    the promised linguistic treat
    Have you ever heard of Tom Swift books / jokes?
    Yes, a needle in a haystack, true! STUDENT:
    no I haven't heard of him...",0.99949657,0.99672471
56990,"TEACHER:
    I've never read the books, but they are apparently sci-fi for teenagers or something like that
    But! they gave birth to a whole series of jokes that mimick the style of the book
    The jokes are based on puns (do you know this one?) STUDENT:
    No, I don't know it sorry...",0.86945539,0.887826911
56991,"TEACHER:
    a play on the fact that a particular word has more than one meaning
    I'll give you an example
    What's black and white and red (= read) all over? - a newspaper STUDENT:
    Oh, now I see! Sorry...",0.603539272,0.284440123
56992,"TEACHER:
    This is a pun based on the fact that 'red' and 'read' have the same pronunciation STUDENT:
    I though you were asking about thi series of jokes, I assumed this was also published as a book or something...
    Okay, I actually knew that a 'pun' was some sort of joke, but I didn't know it involved word's meaning in particular.",0.73877197,0.997512345
56993,"TEACHER:
    Oh sorry, I confused you! No, I was just trying to say that 'Tom said' jokes are based on some wordplay
    Ok, let's have a look at a couple of jokes, I wonder if you know both meaning of words... STUDENT:
    Okay!",0.999083452,0.652991259
56994,"TEACHER:
    • 'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.
    Here, the play is on the fact that a crypt is a burial place, like a mausoleum, but cryptically means 'with an air of mystery'
    Does it make sense? STUDENT:
    haha...okay, cryptically refers both to in a manner of speaking, as if hiding something, and refers to crypts? The old cemetery
    yes",,0.999336484
56995,"TEACHER:
    Yes!! I needn't have explained it to you :)
    another one
    • 'Pass me the shellfish,' said Tom crabbily. STUDENT:
    Hmm...this time you need to explain me...or better, I am pretty sure that crabbiliy refers also to crabs
    but I don't know the other meaning of the word",0.343100148,0.994101703
56996,"TEACHER:
    Well, yes, it comes from 'crab', but it means grumpy and bad-tempered! STUDENT:

    Good non-Latin word)) The boss is well crabby today or something like that STUDENT:

    ok

    Yes thanks <STUDENT> that's great language well done ....be careful with the proportion though! Check the units ok?
    Is it really 25%? STUDENT:
    wow, it is not 100 units...
    sorry, my internet became slowly just now",0.997011366,0.972221143

    no that's ok....so no, it's not 100 units...
    How can you say it then? STUDENT:
    so...approximately 27% of electricity form/by coal.",0.999476902,0.891825215
57069,"TEACHER:
    OK thanks... wow, you could try and work it out like that if you like....maybe an easier way would be to say e.g. 25 out of 90 units OR more than a quarter ...OK? STUDENT:
    ok",0.39939066,0.629589191
57070,"TEACHER:
    So in fact <STUDENT> fractions (half/third/quarter etc) are good to use for variety in language OK?
    So for example ...52% = just _____ half? STUDENT:
    just more than half
    just exceeding half",,0.966724276
57071,"TEACHER:
    can you try it with just one word in the gap?
    beginning with 'o'! STUDENT:
    just over half",0.572381994,0.294400377

    YEs thanks! I think that's best..
    It is best! STUDENT:
    ok,thanks",0.534650197,0.899603908

    and what about e.g. 23%? STUDENT:
    just over third.
    just over fifth",,0.588993757
57074,"TEACHER:
    Yes!
    Or just ________ a quarter? STUDENT:
    just less a quarter",0.876063544,0.998492284
57075,"TEACHER:
    so if you say 'less' you need to say 'less than' ....so just use one word ok? beginning with 'u'! STUDENT:
    just u.... a quarter",0.966810424,0.835863964

    opposite of 'over' STUDENT:
    I am not sure that word..",0.688971001,0.863376565

    under!
    just under a quarter STUDENT:
    haha...thanks",0.585058626,0.753202473
57078,"TEACHER:
    ok! STUDENT:
    just under a quarter",,
57079,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's it good...So by the way you need 'a' before all fractions except for 'half' (although it's possible to out it in for 'half' too)
    so e.g. a third/a quarter STUDENT:
    ok, I got it",0.939951256,0.597336664
57080,"TEACHER:
    when it's just one I mean...actually 'one' is correct too right? so a/one third etc
    BUT e.g. two fifths/three quarters etc ...obviously without 'a'
    So <STUDENT>...last individual one...What about coal in Australia in 2000?! Tell me about that in one sentence (try a fraction if you like too) STUDENT:
    ok, it is a very different way to explain date",0.306839774,0.401358881
57081,"TEACHER:
    Do you mean fractions? STUDENT:
    cola was 130 out of 170 units in Australia in 2000",0.198809896,0.074445281
57082,"TEACHER:
    OK fine...hol don
    hold on I mean! STUDENT:
    ok",0.471748397,0.80076124
57083,"TEACHER:
    So yes fine - good to get that little structure 'out of' correct ! OR ... e.g. Coal accounted for 130 out of 170 units of electricity OR e.g. Coal generated 130 out of 170 units STUDENT:
    ok, I understand,,thanks",,0.350348214
57084,"TEACHER:
    And the passive structure? Remember that possibility? So e.g. 130 out of 170 units of electricity...(Can you finish this one?) STUDENT:
    130 out of 170 units of electricity form/by coal.",0.701236652,0.999459329
57085,"TEACHER:
    yes ok but you need a verb somewhere! STUDENT:
    130 out of 170 units of electricity was produced from/by coal",0.433518141,0.509862058
57086,"TEACHER:
    yes ok good thanks! Because it's units it is plural so we need 'were produced from' (good to use verb 'produced' by the way) STUDENT:
    ok,i got it,thanks",0.994795469,0.769362581
57087,"TEACHER:
    OK <STUDENT> so let's take another step here OK? So we have given the  basic numbers for coal in 2000 (130 out of 170 units) ...but what does really mean? It's good if we can say that in words you know?
    What i mean is ...in bad English we might say: 'Yes coal really big 2000' do you see? But in good IELTS English we could say...?
    Not the numbers just this idea in words STUDENT:
    Coal was by far the most popular fuel, with 130 out of 170 units were produced.",0.537389159,0.999158925
57088,"TEACHER:
    THanks <STUDENT> - a very good sentence overall...hold on STUDENT:
    ok",0.826594224,0.830283916
57089,"TEACHER:
    So if we make 2 basic correct sentences we could get: Coal was by far the most significant (better than 'popular' here because people aren't actually choosing it like Coca cola you see?) fuel. It produced 130 out of 170 units. OK? STUDENT:
    ok, it is better than my sentence.",,0.949123299
57090,"TEACHER:
    Well yes I guess so! BUT we can take one more step if we like....Look at the one coming up...can you see I have deleted the full stop and the verb - you just need to change the form of the verb ..can you try it?Coal was by far the most significant fuel, _________  130 out of 170 units
    So e.g. 'produce/produced/producing'? you decide! STUDENT:
    ok, less verbs make sentences more academic.
    produced
    because it was in 2000.",0.91177404,0.989072444
57091,"TEACHER:
    OK right so I know what you mean BUT remember 'prodcued was in the original two sentence version but here we are changing it so we need: ...Coal was by far the most significant fuel, producing130 out of 170 units
    Have you seen that before? STUDENT:
    no.. I just could write very simple sentences before.",0.886126282,0.964455341
57092,"TEACHER:
    OK well don't worry too much - the first two-sentence version was still good and you could still get a high score with that OK? STUDENT:
    ok
    hanks
    thanks",0.957604917,0.46387398
57093,"TEACHER:
    OK <STUDENT> before we finish this hour let me ask you one final question....can you tell me about nuclear power in France in 1980 AND 2000. So you could try it like this: 'In 1980, nuclear power.....However, in 2000....' OK?! STUDENT:
    ok..
    in 1980, nuclear power accounted for 15 out of 90 units of electricity,However, in 2000, it was by far the most signifiant fuel, producing 126 out of 180 units.

    Well, it turns out, the Queen has much more power than we ever knew! Apparently, she looks at bills before they go to the Parliament and she has changed / thrown away some of them, especially the ones that are not good for her.

    I see",0.894249305,0.656185018

58904,"STUDENT:
    Do you recommend that forums to learn English?
    Those, sorry TEACHER:
    Well I think taht for a more advanced learner they are, as i say, a really rich source of spoken-style language
    they contain a huge amount of authentic idiomatic language for esample
    And i;ve been looking at some in English to think about English teaching and it's confirmed this idea",0.981509795,0.912884822
58905,"STUDENT:
    It sounds very good
    I don't think we've talked about it before...
    could you mention the ones you know? TEACHER:
    But it's great because for example you get one youtube video and hundreds of comments and they all naturally use a whole range of language to describe the same thing you know? It's like a mini-corpus!
    Yes nothing special - I just mean on e.g. youtube videos or newspaper websites (where they have comment sections after opinion pieces for example)",0.931393152,0.874143166

    I watched the first 2 minutes
    yes, thanking everyone for not organising barbecues in the park TEACHER:
    OK! So you get the idea....he gets more personal later, thanking individual nurses etc (ironically they're immigrants!)
    I wonder <STUDENT> - is this similar to what a Spanish politician would do?",0.701985668,0.87402574
58912,"STUDENT:
    Yes I know, I saw him on the Spanish news talking about his hero 'a Portuguese nurse' TEACHER:

58913,"STUDENT:
    great! TEACHER:
    here are the first 5 .... my quick overall question first is: Which one supports Boris?
    1. Maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - I'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. It was only ever going to go one way lol 3. I’m so glad you’re ok Mr Johnson. I shouted “YES!” when I heard you were discharged from hospital. You’re the best prime minister we have had. Caring, hardworking and selfless attitude in the midst of this crisis. Truly admirable. Please rest after your ordeal and watch some more movies and play video games! You deserve it. 4. You actually sound a bit more more human, and humble, for the first time. I hope that your close brush with death means you will, in the future, protect our precious NHS and other public services. 5. What a load of bollocks, knew he’d recover straight away",,0.77839906
58914,"STUDENT:
    haha a variety of opinions TEACHER:

    And quite similar to real speaking a lot of it....",0.921976452,0.801553544
58915,"STUDENT:
    Yes
    I didn't konw you could use the word 'bugger' to call a person TEACHER:
    OK so as you can imagine most of the people posting comments are critical! Only one is unequivocally pro-Boris right? Yes...a bugger! A little bit old-fashioned perhaps (and not that rude any more)
    OK <STUDENT> so a few language questions for you if you're ready...",0.998656438,0.733068973
58916,"STUDENT:
    ahh good! I thought it was an expression, something like 'shit!'
    yes, I'm ready! TEACHER:
    Yes, you;re right ... it;s that too like if you;re hurt yourself/forget something for example (bit less rude than shit)",0.584875405,0.947205225
58917,"STUDENT:
    I see TEACHER:
    Can you find a word/phrase in the 5 comments with the following meaning? They’re in the right order by the way):   a) get better/not die! b) allowed to leave hospital  c) generous d) unpleasant and prolonged experience  e) brief contact with something unpleasant f) rubbish
    1. Maybe this bugger can start doing his job now and clear up this mess - I'm glad he pulled through but come on! 2. It was only ever going to go one way lol 3. I’m so glad you’re ok Mr Johnson.

    OK great",0.827329933,0.79012189
58919,"STUDENT:
    Not sure about the meaning of the second one... Does that person mean that being the prime minister he had to survive?? TEACHER:
    Ah yes good question - this is a bit ambiguous....",0.930700947,0.400313154
58920,"STUDENT:
    B)to be discharged from hospital (you taught me that one a few days ago ;) TEACHER:
    most neutral meaning = just chances are he wouldn't die statistically you know?",0.460693223,0.542732805
58921,"STUDENT:
    yes, I get that person is being ironical, am I right? number 2 TEACHER:

    what do you mean?? from less rude to more rude?? TEACHER:

    Thank you! that's very useful... It's hard when you learn these kind of words

    YEs sure....it;s the use rather than the basic meaning which gets harder as you get more advanced of course...",0.96678008,0.999398049
58932,"STUDENT:
    the problem I think is that you don't learn them at school, generally you pick them up from people TEACHER:
    OK well in linguistics it just means the variety of language you;re using (e.g. vocab/grammar/pronunciation) often measured in terms of formality",0.88766132,0.851333615

    Yes, I think so TEACHER:

Jeez looks like he’s lost two stone  4. I’m happy for Boris no matter what your politics no one wishes anyone to die that way. Now you are better Boris give the nurses more money please. 5.

    a) something surprising that you learn from b) change something to a new form - especially a plan or something more abstract into something (more) real c) US = “Emergency Room” or “ER” UK = “  _______ and ______” OR “__ + __” d) IF you want to ask someone if they are left-wing or right -wing you can ask: “What are your _________.”?",0.216081717,0.537249915

    So <STUDENT>...inversion....",0.875653878,0.735764574
58956,"STUDENT:
    now I know but before you explained I didn't! thanks
    yes, inversion!! TEACHER:
    OK....so we use it for with a limited number of phrases/words - basically negative adverbs - to make something limited or emphatic....
    for example....the word never (a limiting word let's say...) hold on
    I have never seen such a terrible sight = Never have i seen such a ...you see?",0.492882324,0.997945436

    I have a question about something you wrote yesterday. In the sentence 'Not only do I like chocolate I also like cake', do we need to write 'do'?? TEACHER:
    yes we do! Hold on....",0.9602118,0.155708017
58958,"STUDENT:
    I understand the example with never TEACHER:
    OK that's good/...
    With the present simple v, and past simple verbs we need  auxiliary verb do/did
    and also make the main verb the infinitive ...
    for example....hold on
    Not only does he love chocolate...
    i.e. he + love NOT loves",0.829076159,0.409324418
58959,"STUDENT:
    ok
    I didn't know we need auxiliary in affirmative sentences TEACHER:
    One last example: He only realised later that ... = only later did her realise that...
    Yes not normally - but inversion is a special case",0.80085339,0.991119236

    I see TEACHER:

    Yes, I know that... but it is different, isn't it?? TEACHER:
    in fact I Could have written: you know that we do sometimes say I do like...",0.422082233,0.687555978
58962,"STUDENT:
    In I do like chocolate I can remove 'do' but in inversion we can't (if I understood well) TEACHER:
    Yes that's true of course..",0.732881734,0.959514386
58963,"STUDENT:
    okk TEACHER:
    I guess it's a bit similar in the sense that it's related to emphasis",,0.867860208

    From now I'll use 'do' all the time TEACHER:
    yes - and actually not really exaggerated - we might really say that and it wouldn't sound strange
    Go for it! Seriously, it's much more common than we think...",0.252231077,0.932542325

    same with did?? TEACHER:
    It's not always accompanied by a big dramatic tone/gesture/statment",0.272650437,0.194951553

    I mean, is it also common?? TEACHER:
    yes the same in the past
    and common",0.99760741,0.736420798
58969,"STUDENT:
    Ok TEACHER:
    For example we often just use it to draw attention to something
    not in a big dramatic way
    for example...I did want to go out later (actually)",,0.824980287
58970,"STUDENT:
    I see TEACHER:
    just a gentle way of suggesting that even though maybe it's late/we're busy or whatever (not always stated) i still wan tto go out
    Some of the phrases we invert by the way are pretty formal but not all
    Formal ones = for example: scarcely/seldom/little
    more normal: not only/only then",0.751248191,0.73816706
58971,"STUDENT:
    Are these the adverbs that go at the beginning?? TEACHER:
    yes exactly..so e.g. Seldom have I been so impressed by blah blah

58973,"STUDENT:
    yes, I knew what you meant TEACHER:
    Yeah - it's interesting - because it's one of those 'grammar' things that doesn;t really change the meaning so you can basically not notice it and it doesn't really matter
    i.e. that's why people don't notice it",0.75189856,0.8259186
58974,"STUDENT:
    I'm surprised but I don't remember studying that at all... maybe I did and I've forgotten about it TEACHER:

58975,"STUDENT:
    Maybe...
    Just to clarify... TEACHER:
    Ah - did you see my auxiliary there? I did that one without thinking (e.g. It IS something that's covered...)
    yes go ahead
    you'd hear the difference in speaking (i.e. emphatic) easily",0.789608657,0.896172374

    If the inverted sentence (do you call them like this) is in past simple we use DID and if it is in present simple we use DO TEACHER:

    yep...",,0.807410796

    if it's in present simple you don't use auxiliary but you invert the order (have he...)
    but for present or past simple you don't invert the order (did he think...)

    Ah right i see hold on...",0.674958083,
58979,"STUDENT:
    Am I right?? I deduced that from your examples but no idea... TEACHER:
    well, in the present perfect the auxiliary is 'have' right? so, e.g. Not only has he stolen from me, he has also lied blah blah SAME idea in the present = Not only does he steal from me he...OK?
    Nice verb 'deduced' by the way!",0.956192879,0.233986774

    yes  that's it",0.839699768,0.997546009

    and do you have an informal word for that? TEACHER:
    some people might never say it I guess...",0.802457807,0.992731976
58984,"STUDENT:
    maybe 'guess'? TEACHER:
    um ..well i guess like lots of these things it would be replaced by a phrasal verb often - so e.g. work out
    or guess of vourse yes
    but 'work out' is maybe best here
    i just mean more common",0.981758077,0.975945619
58985,"STUDENT:
    ok, thanks
    Could we practise the inverted sentences a bit? TEACHER:
    because it's like a little process you know? 'Guess' i soften just a quick little or one-step  thing
    yes sure - i'll give you a prompt OK? UNless you have an idea of your own first?",0.908509811,0.891562719

    Sure, I see the difference between guess and work out. I sometimes struggle to use phrasal verbs because I don't know where to write the thing I worked out...

    yes! well most are 'separable' so e.g. work out something OR work something out = both correct",0.968660508,0.699047432

    About a prompt, yes please

    For now yes...actually her children go to school so in the morning they currently are alone, but a new child might come. Actually, there was an attempt but the child's mother was too protective: a child of almost two years who wouldn't eat anything solid, not even a banana...

    Ok, great. Actually, with this task, you're looking for links between paragraphs. The text really is very big, but there are distinct links that can help to complete the task without reading everyting in-depth
    The first two are correct, let's try to find those links
    One second
    Why is the first one D? STUDENT:
    .I also think this is easier to do on paper as you can cross sentences you used and visually see what is remaning.",0.984613685,0.756920517
59306,"TEACHER:
    Yes, definitely. But I think, if you happen to take the computer-based version of the test, you can drag-and-drop paragraphs, which is quite helpful visually STUDENT:
    Hmm...now that I am reading it I am not sure anymore
    I think it was the beginning: 'In times gone by, all seven islands...' and then the stories goes on
    in the paragraph 'Sometime in the last century, the last of the trees on high ground were'",0.987819426,0.735686371
59307,"TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly. The first paragraph: how Spanish sailors found the Canaries .flourishing agriculture.. Paragraph 2 .D.: deforestation begins Paragraph 3: the last of the trees are cut down
    Also, .D. gives us the name of the island. In the first paragraph, it's just 'the Canaries', and in paragraph 3 they are talking about 'the north of the island', so we're supposed to know which island it is
    Something that D fills in for us STUDENT:
    could 39. be F, since it talks about fog not touching the ground...and then there is a paragraph about fog harvesting? But I still have a problem with the previous paragraph talking about Chile..",0.993884653,0.823097519
59308,"TEACHER:
    One sec, I'll look at 39
    Yes, correct! Riebold explains why saplings died without fog harvesting
    By the way, to go back to 38, there is such a good link there. The next paragraph starts with 'these failed efforts', so you know that 38 needs to be the description of the failed efforts STUDENT:
    Oh, I didn't notice...but yes, I should have noticed that...",0.998898652,0.4985697
59309,"TEACHER:
    Ok, we've got 37 D, 38 H, 39 F
    Would you like to have a go at 40? STUDENT:
    40 B since the previous paragraph tells about the first project starting
    And in B you have some results of these first trials .2 liters collected, when 1 was enough.",0.413919295,0.449474916
59310,"TEACHER:
    Yes, and also the following paragraph says 'having declared the initial project a success' .so we need a success story for 40.
    Correct STUDENT:
    .when 1 would have been enough...? Are both these expression okay?.",0.986621188,0.099137122
59311,"TEACHER:
    1 would have been enough .but they had two, so it's a conditional.
    vs. They collected 1 litre for each tree, and that was enough. STUDENT:
    I see, okay thank you :.",0.998622014,0.735577431
59312,"TEACHER:
    No problem. 41? STUDENT:
    I don't know...there is a line about irrigation which could be linked to farmers .and thus G.",0.767313871,0.241508944
59313,"TEACHER:
    Ok, let's leave 41 for now. What about 42? There's a very clear link in the first sentence of the following paragraph STUDENT:
    42 A
    the paragraph ends talking about a bigger project covering 50 square kilometers
    and A starts talking about a more ambitious scheme",0.32544762,0.996780083
59314,"TEACHER:
    But the knock-on effect of reviving the forest goes beyond restoring wildlife'
    Which means that the paragraph should talk about... restoring wildlife STUDENT:
    Oh, in that case it's E",0.830249628,0.664083157
59315,"TEACHER:
    Yes, correct! STUDENT:
    then 43 is G, I guess, since the next paragraph begins with 'Whether or not fog harvesting will prompt a large- scale return to agriculture'",0.823205693,0.771468411
59316,"TEACHER:
    I see what you're saying about 'this more ambitious scheme' with A, actually, but it doesn't work with the following paragraph
    Absolutely, we finally get to the farmers in 43
    So you've now used D, H, F, B, E and G
    The options for 41 are A and C STUDENT:
    I guess C
    I guess it's C...but why...mm
    I don't see clear links to be honest",0.99737444,0.954376019
59317,"TEACHER:
    No, there aren't. C is suddenly a story about the past, doesn't really work here
    I've got to let you go, it's obviously A byt he process of elimination. If you have a minute to see why later on, that could be part of the homework, together with the last task if you have the time STUDENT:
    Okay, I will do that...I guess now I will take a break because I my mind i really a bit fogged ;.
    Thank you for the lesson! Have a nice week!",0.960267222,0.864725122
59318,"TEACHER:
    Missing paragraphs' is probably the most challenging reading task, well done, you're almost there!
    You too, have a lovely week, speak to you next Tuesday! STUDENT:
    Thank you! You too...see you on Tuesday!",0.986236703,0.987826877

    Hi <TEACHER> TEACHER:
    Hi, how are you doing?",0.998718317,0.997088967
59322,"STUDENT:
    How do you say 'passing the days'??
    Do you have an expression for that? TEACHER:
    Um...not really I guess the translation could be ...e.g. 'surviving' or 'getting by'",0.919197133,0.018780067
59323,"STUDENT:
    Exactly that... surviving
    How about you? TEACHER:
    Well...surviving I guess! I'm at home now and basically 'social distancing' is the new norm
    So pretty limited
    also I hurt my knee which is annoying (poor me)",0.999204646,0.998579226

    Finally!! TEACHER:
    Yes finally
    although not enforced as yet....",,0.374533071
59325,"STUDENT:
    ohh yes, poor you! Is it serious? TEACHER:
    well I hope not - I've had a couple of operations before (sports injuries) but it might not be tat bad ...just gotta wait and see
    but I go a bit crazy without movement you know",0.929853713,0.754969731
59326,"STUDENT:
    Hope you get better soon TEACHER:
    yeah thanks - it's OK - mind over matter - I;m serious you know? It's a good mental test
    as in it's the way you look at things right?",0.869125913,0.775688025
59327,"STUDENT:
    Yes, I know what you mean... I feel the same. I just went to exercise a bit inside my building but we're not suppose to... TEACHER:
    not even inside?
    you mean on the stairs or something?",0.984086632,0.655550675
59328,"STUDENT:
    no :(. I don't understand why not. I just talked to one of my neighbours and he told me (in a good way) that if I do it, everyone would do it too. And I really think that we could plan a half and hour-walk for everyone during the day...
    half-and-hour-walk? TEACHER:
    a half-hour walk (you mean 30 minutes right?)",0.998503161,0.897271002

    hehe I see TEACHER:
    and how about a simlar phrase for 90 minutes? can iyou try it?",0.843468094,0.423989497
59330,"STUDENT:
    we could have a ninety-minute walk
    ?? TEACHER:
    yes fine thanks just checking!
    yes you'd think there'd be a way to manage soemthing",0.589302654,0.99426816
59331,"STUDENT:
    Thank you!! it's so different in Spanish TEACHER:
    sure i remember having problems the other way round
    Hey <STUDENT>...are you still planning (or did you do) to do a CAE exam?",0.60356318,0.559499701
59332,"STUDENT:
    I'm sure... I think it's important that we go out a bit for our mental and fisical health
    Fisical health is not right, how do you say it? TEACHER:
    Yes I agree - mental health is important - oh sure physical!
    although often when we mean physical health we just say 'health' of course
    shows you the bias towards that side of things",0.99902271,0.240501357
59333,"STUDENT:
    About the CAE exam, a month ago I decided to postpone it. I was doing too many things and I was very stressed... I couldn't sleep well. So I decided to postpone what wasn't urgent TEACHER:
    yes I see - sounds like it was a good idea - I guess it's not possible to do the exams at the moment anyway...",0.992466242,0.31403619

    I suddenly now I have soooo much free time... haha live is showing us that we shouldn't plan so much TEACHER:

    me too :)

    let me think...
    influential?? TEACHER:
    adjective endings.....-ive/-ous--ial ...choose one of these!

    yes right idea for the meaning = good BUT you need a noun i.e. the thing that led him...
    add a noun ending to your adjective",0.244347872,

    no i don't actually - but there you go - good extensive listening",0.988664236,0.813213754

    no, never TEACHER:
    it's like protest/controversy/opposition

    I understan, thanks TEACHER:

    I'm sure... TEACHER:

    Can you give an example? I can't think of any TEACHER:

    pass
    overtake
    ? not sure TEACHER:
    Ah well possible I guess - as in the moment itself - but more generally we can say 'outrun'
    by the way overtake good idea and very common (but still only for the moment itself)",0.996013195,0.638111964
59358,"STUDENT:
    Another new word for me!! TEACHER:
    lots of Spanish speakers just say pass - good to have thought of overtake = very natural
    but yes 'outrun' = normal too so good to know
    What about e.g. score more points than?",0.68719016,0.748270168

    no idea TEACHER:
    outscore!

    yes!

    but I don't know how to use these words!!
    For example, can I say 'My team outscored more points than yours'? TEACHER:
    Well for example....if Mnachester UNIted beat Barcelona 5-0 then the sports report might say that they outfought, outran, outmuscled, outscored, outplayed Barcelona
    any combination of these verbs!
    and others too!",0.991932653,0.932429083

    i see TEACHER:
    bit more formal than some phrases but still you'll hear these words a fair bit",0.661251029,0.640738443
59363,"STUDENT:
    So the example I wrote is not correct, is it? TEACHER:
    by the way 'outnumber' was the last one - this is really common...as in e.g. males outnumber females in senior managemnt roles (or whatever!)
    sorry  - which example are you saying wasn't correct?",0.777657747,0.569946445
59364,"STUDENT:
    I'll try to correct it... My team outscored yours last night
    Before your examples, I wrote one TEACHER:
    Oh sorry I see it now!
    Yes you just need to say 'outscore' because this already includes the idea of 'points'
    this is why it's quite efficent you see!

    In Germany then can still go out for walks with one person... I think they are much more sensible than Spanish people... TEACHER:

    About your daughter and children in general, I know it's really hard but then I think of children who live in Siria for example where they can leave their houses because there are bombs and I think that we are lucky... TEACHER:

    How are you? And where are you in the world?",0.998000399,0.999087465
59573,"STUDENT:
    Thank you! And thank you for letting me improve my English with this study!
    I am fine, thank you. Just a bit cold, it is getting cold here in Austria.
    I am Italian, but I moved to Graz last year. TEACHER:
    Oh Austria, interesting!
    All the pastry and music :)",0.986824436,0.938766082
59574,"STUDENT:
    Yes, it is a nice place to be :) And you? Are you from the UK? TEACHER:
    I'm from Ukraine, but I've lived in the UK for the last few years
    Do you speak German as well?",0.997536516,0.627084832
59575,"STUDENT:
    Oh, I see...so you also know what it means to leave your country. Even though I suspect you knew the language before reaching the Uk.
    I speak some German, but I am still working on it (the covid lockdown didn't help). I also speak Spanish to a decent level. TEACHER:
    Yes, I was an English teacher and Cambridge examiner back in Ukraine. And yes, I know about the whole leaving far from home / making a new country your second home
    Amazing, you're a polyglot!
    I learned some German at university, but I'm a good few years out of practice and oh so rusty :)",0.991618495,0.996570983
59576,"STUDENT:
    Sort of polyglot...but I enjoy learning languages. Well, you also speak many languages!
    I believe it is easy to get rusty with German: it is easy to forget about grammar and nouns' genders. TEACHER:
    I don't really count German among them any more. Oh my, genders and cases basically broke me!
    Even though there are only three cases in German whereas my native Russian has six and Ukrainian 7. It didn't help!",0.994620759,0.999184088
59577,"STUDENT:
    As an Italian I also have troubles with long words...I really believe English to be a lot easier... TEACHER:
    Do nouns have genders in Italian?
    Oh yes, German's notorious for its long words, isn't it?
    Yes, I agree, there is a reason English took over the world",0.998812817,0.893270873
59578,"STUDENT:
    Yes, only masculine and feminine...but, unlike with German, there are some simple rules to identify a noun's gender. That is, you mostly know by reading the last vowel. TEACHER:
    Yes, very similar to Russian / Ukrainian. Basically, does it end in 'a' :)",0.874278215,0.999162717
59579,"STUDENT:
    It is notorious...and, while these words are logical and organised, I don't see the point in having a single word to say 'bread with pumpkin's seeds' TEACHER:
    Haha, I see your point!!
    But I like that German is a bit like Lego. Once you've learned the most common roots, you can guess the meaning of many words",0.929362146,0.24682751
59580,"STUDENT:
    Indeed that is true...and I also find it more 'precise' than Italian. Don't get me wrong: you can be precise with Italian, but in German it is as if the language is ingrained with some rules that force you to be precise. TEACHER:
    Hmm, that's an interesting observation. Would you say English and German have that in common?",0.995912189,0.985416656
59581,"STUDENT:
    While I find English more 'practical' when talking about technical things...both because most technical terms are in English and because it has a somewhat simplified grammar with respect to Italian.
    I would say English is a bit more on the practical side, German on the precision side. But I'd say English is closed to German in this. TEACHER:
    Interesting, I've got to think about this one!
    Yes, I suppose as a Germanic language it will be
    A tiny thing: we don't really use possessive 's with inanimate nouns
    For example, <STUDENT>'s book vs. the genders of nounds
    *nouns, sorry",0.968224181,0.997608407
59582,"STUDENT:
    Indeed I felt weird when typing 'pumpkin's'.. TEACHER:
    Yes, that's it, you probably know it intuitively!
    The names of animals count as animate nounds too, e.g. a swan's bill, a squirrel's tail
    but 'the legs of a table'",0.672625169,0.530994621
59583,"STUDENT:
    Unfortunately I like to use language: I have read a lot in English. Thank you! TEACHER:
    This is not unfortunate, is it? :)",0.333196342,0.882140803
59584,"STUDENT:
    but 'bread with seeds of pumpkin' doesn't sound right... TEACHER:
    Oh, and 's is used with time phrases too, as you probably know. this week's newspaper, a month's salary",0.351348909,0.642768422
59585,"STUDENT:
    No, it isn't...but I realise just now how much I know 'intuitively' but I don't really control. TEACHER:
    No, that's because it's 'pumpkin seeds' :)",0.096416761,0.410838544
59586,"STUDENT:
    okay...so a day's work, yes, I know this intuitively TEACHER:
    That's a sign of someone who is bilingual or a native speaker
    It's only if you learn the language from textbooks that you know the rules",0.593251341,0.550348563
59587,"STUDENT:
    Okay, then I will be extra careful about it ;) Even though my guess would be that many English speakers get it wrong too...
    I agree with you on learning from the textbooks...the problem is that oftentimes, especially here in Italy, you study the grammar before you really know how to write a proper sentence. TEACHER:
    Back to the bread, you can just go with 'pumpkin seed bread'
    German-style, but in three words
    Yes, that's how I learnt English, grammar first! I feel that it pays off though if you have a chance to practise a lot afterwards",0.990011475,0.999093773
59588,"STUDENT:
    Easier to pronounce ;) okay...so in general I would put before the noun 'bread' the adjectives, in this case pumpkin seed.
    Or whole flower bread...okay, I got this! TEACHER:
    Yes, that would make a compound noun
    Yes, wholewheat flour bread",0.998259567,0.998959632
59589,"STUDENT:
    Well, after high school I studied math and now I work with artificial intelligence: so I always used English for 'practical' reasons, but it has been a while since I opened a grammar book. TEACHER:
    Or sourdough bread, the lockdown craze in the UK :)",0.071975392,0.163320087
59590,"STUDENT:
    haha, yes! I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the US American spelling...
    would that be wrong? TEACHER:
    Hmm, let me think.
    Whole milk vs. (semi-)skimmed milk
    but wholewheat flour
    We want to stress here that the flour is made out of whole wheat
    rather than the idea that the flour is whole",0.998047244,0.995639361
59591,"STUDENT:
    I am unsure about what 'flour is whole' would mean... TEACHER:
    Oh, what I mean is that we use 'wholewheat flour' as opposed to 'whole flour'
    because, as you say, 'whole flour' does not make sense",0.999482873,0.999075255
59592,"STUDENT:
    okay, thank you for the clarification! TEACHER:
    No worries. You mentioned that you are interested in punctuation in the sign-up form
    In the following sentence, a punctuation mark could make it much clearer what you mean
    I wanted to write 'whole flour bread' but then I stopped fearing that this is the US American spelling...",0.491766372,0.727492554
59593,"STUDENT:
    Yes, punctuation is one of those things that I have never fully understood. The Oxford comma and so on...
    Is there a mistake in that last sentence you copy-pasted? TEACHER:
    Not really, but when I first read it, I thought that you stopped being afraid that this was the American spelling
    as in 'you were not afraid anymore'
    If you put a comma after 'stopped', that would make it much clearer in my opinion",0.997142535,0.998600377
59594,"STUDENT:
    haha...so a grammatically correct sentence, but with a weird meaning...a comma was missing. TEACHER:
    I wanted to write... but then I stopped, fearing that this is the American spelling
    Does it make sense?",0.953542682,0.996574079
59595,"STUDENT:
    Indeed! After you wrote about what you understood while reading the sentence I was wondering wether I would put the comma after 'then' or after 'stopped'...
    Would both options be correct? TEACHER:
    If you put a comma after then, this would definitely read like you are not afraid that this is American spelling anymore))",0.999489455,0.996182275
59596,"STUDENT:
    Yes, indeed...I think this option came to my mind because in Italian there is an expression I would have used in this context i.e., 'poi però', which is often followed by the comma. TEACHER:
    I see! I'm thinking of an example
    I was afraid to go to the market because of the risk of infection, but then, I stopped fearing, put my face mask on and went
    Silly example, just ot illustrate the point
    *to illustrate
    Mind you, your original sentence was good without the comma too, and this is a confusing thing about the English punctuation: very little of it is obligatory or regulated by clear rules",0.993140352,0.996855315
59597,"STUDENT:
    I see your point, but a comma would have made the sentence much less ambiguous... TEACHER:
    Yes, true!
    I'd like to recommend an excellent book on the subject. It's called 'Eats, shoots and leaves' by Lynne Truss",0.475449752,0.997445226
59598,"STUDENT:
    Thank you for the recommendation! I will definitely take a look at it! TEACHER:
    It's a really engaging read and explains some of those punctuation nuances really well
    The title was inspired by a joke about a panda. Do you know this one?",0.564658896,0.986004706
59599,"STUDENT:
    No, I don't...
    ...and I don't see how pandas could come into play with that title, to be honest ;) TEACHER:
    Well, a panda walks into a cafe, eats a sandwich, then produces a gun, fires two shots in the air and heads towards the exit
    The waiter asks, 'What was this about?'
    The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and shows it to the waiter
    The entry for 'panda' says, 'Panda. Large black-and-white mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.'",0.995697189,0.998529009
59600,"STUDENT:
    Haha...this time there was an extra comma! Very nice :) TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly! The importance of punctuation))
    So, what kind of AI are you working on?",0.169789975,0.510806619
59601,"STUDENT:
    Currently I am working on a few projects...but the main one, which made me realise that my English knowledge is okay but not excellent, is about GEC...that is, you guessed it, Grammatical Error Correction. TEACHER:
    Interesting! Are there any areas of grammar that you think you would like to improve?
    Your English is excellent, and I'm nit-picking to find something to help you with, to be honest",0.992423028,0.961522757
59602,"STUDENT:
    Well, thank you! I am not sure...as an Italian I realise that my language use is a bit peculiar, for example I tend to use a lot of words with latin etymology. If you noticed this, maybe I would like to know some more common alternatives...
    Or there are some sentences which I am not sure if or why they are correct. I guess those could shed some light on some grammatical areas I don't fully control. TEACHER:
    Oh I see what you are saying (I haven't noticed). It would be wrong not to take advantage of 60% of the English wordstock. If I recall correctly, this is how much the words of Latin origin make up",0.986007402,0.990478504
59603,"STUDENT:
    I see, then I will ask you the following:
    Is the sentence 'There are two teachers in class' wrong? I have found something similar in a grammar book, and they suggested 'There are two teachers in the class' as the correct version.
    Do they have different meanings, or is me not seeing what is wrong with the first one? TEACHER:
    Ah, articles! Yes, you usually need to use 'the' with indications of place",0.890166411,0.869132794
59604,"STUDENT:
    What I was wondering is if, in this case, 'class' could also mean 'lesson' and so the first one could be correct... TEACHER:
    Class' in this sentence is a singular noun, so you need some kind of an article.",0.9953234,0.664051869
59605,"STUDENT:
    As in two teachers are teaching the lesson...but maybe it would be a singular noun anyway... TEACHER:
    I see what you're saying, but class=lesson is also a singular noun and requires an article
    Yes, that's right!
    And, just like you said right now, you would be more likely to say 'two teachers are teaching a class'",0.999508752,0.999452723
59606,"STUDENT:
    Okay, anyway thank you for clearing that up! I didn't realise there are this many rules connect with 'animated objects' or 'indications of place'. TEACHER:
    I've got an idea. Maybe you could send me a piece of your writing that you think could be improved prior to the next class? Then we could have a more focussed practice next time, looking at the grammar, style and punctuation",0.475251988,0.744212497
59607,"STUDENT:
    Yes, that is definitely an option. Okay! I will sent you two pieces of writing. One written in a speedy manner, one more carefully... TEACHER:
    Ok, excellent! Would a class at the same time next week suit you?",0.76797655,0.986426683

    I would prefer it to start at 11:00, but if that is not possible 9:30 will be fine :)

    that's ok, please give me a minute to calculate the time difference
    is it 11 GMT?",0.943922747,0.939868118

    <STUDENT> let me give you your paragraph from yesterday....
    One of the most significant negative effects of playing video games is that they can lead to violent behaviour. It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. Because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. As a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example. STUDENT:
    yes.. I learn a new word of 'copy' is 'imitate'",0.9191997,0.976952802
59753,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's a very good idea! You could definitely use it here
    This is quite good in many ways...but I wonder: there are 4 sentences here. Can you put them in a different order so the paragraph is a bit more logical? You only have to change one sentence (I mean put it in a different place) Which one ?
    1,2,3, or 4?

    apply 2 to 1",0.661441072,0.251797707

Because many games are designed for adults, they may often contain violent content. It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality. As a result, young people are likely to copy the violence they see, and this can result in them bullying classmates for example.

    Speaking, however......",0.843701152,0.919401878
59810,"TEACHER:
    Ha, I'm like that too, to be honest!
    As you probably know, a part of the speaking is a collaborative task where you discuss something with the other candidate
    And at least two parts are picture-based. An examiner gives you some pictures and asks questions based on them
    Also, you will be expected to comment on the questions the other candidate is asked .not on their answers, thankfully!.
    But there are also some plain old question at the end, which give you a chance to speak on your own for a longer time STUDENT:
    Yes. I remember",0.977179129,0.431476378

    Even though some examiners invite an exchange of opinions between candidates as well

    Right",0.704080541,0.857985323
59812,"TEACHER:
    The first part, however, are nice warm-up questions
    The examiner says, I'd like to find out something about you. Where are you from? Are you working or studying? .the traditional beginning of all Cambridge English speaking exams it seems.
    And then something like
    What do you enjoy best about the place where you're living now?
    Could you give me 2-3-4 nice sentences? STUDENT:
    Oh... It'll be tough",,0.422539055
59813,"TEACHER:
    Well, you can always say that at the moment, in lockdown, it's hard to think of things you enjoy - as long as you give a nice answer in terms of language, it doesn't even have to be truthful! STUDENT:
    It would say the location, as my home is in the city center. It takes me 5 minutes to reach the nearest metro station. Moreover, I can just walk to Khreschatyk and avoid using any means of transport all-together. Other perks include the vicinity of the Botanical Garden and other green zones.

    Ok, next Cambridge wants to know, How difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now?
    Back when you just opened ALMA I believe! STUDENT:
    By the way, does the exam panel assess accents?
    Oh right! Maybe at Alias
    My memory has worsen quite a bit after Maya's birth",0.813901298,0.137400901
59817,"TEACHER:
    It's absolutely fine to have an accent, everybody does .even the queen.. They assess intelligibility, the pronunciation / mispronunciation of individual words, sentence stress and intonation
    Yes, it must have been a game of Alias! I can't remember very clearly either
    So unless your accent impedes comprehension, you're fine!
    Ok, so How difficult would it be for you to move away from the area you're living in now?
    .see what they are doing? eliciting conditionals and the language of speculation, like modals. STUDENT:
    Not difficult at all. You see, the advantages I've just provided cannot overrule the disadvantages of my residential area. They are poor air quality, noise pollution, forlorn playgrounds and shabby infrastructure. So I'd move in no time.

    Do you need TOEFL for a particular purpose? There are a few English exams to choose from
    As you know, TOEFL is American and would probably be good if you are planning to move to the USA
    IELTS is another English exam, and that is good for Australia, Canada and the UK STUDENT:

    However, there are other exams that you can take that do not expire after two years

    yes, we meet everyday at 9 on Zoom and we are there listening to our teacher until 2pm

    My question is about when we use in these type of sentences 'me' or 'I'? TEACHER:

    what about 'you and Maria are good friends'?

    OK hold on...let me clear my head!

    Lawns are very important in the English culture. Many people want to create a perfect lawn. But other people say that it's much better for nature to have some flowers there too, not just cut grass, not good for bees!
    And I just think a lawn is a waste of space, I like to grow fruit and vegetables, not lawn!

    Hi David,  It sounds great that your friends are going to have a holiday in my city. As you know, Beijing is the capital of China, so it’s an excellent choice for a holiday. There are a lot of places where they may want to visit, let me introduce some of them. If they want to experience the culture of China, they should go to somewhere like The Palace Museum and Nanluoguxiang where they can see the Chinese historical royal buildings and  eat the classic Chinese food. Also they can visit the Great Wall which is the symbol of Chinese history. And in the Great Wall, they can see the beatiful scenery of Beijing. By the way, because Beijing is one of the biggest cities in China, during the holiday, I think they can travel by subway. In Beijing Subway is so convinient that they can travel to almost all places they want. At last, hope they would have a great time in Beijing, if they have any problem, they can connect with me.

65749,"TEACHER:
    Ah OK - is that true?! OK so: my sister's always wearing my clothes without telling me. (you need the 'always' in there too) - and...how does that make you feel? STUDENT:
    It's okay if she keeps it clean...",0.999506152,0.869042553
65750,"TEACHER:
    OK right - so you don't mind too much...as long as she keeps them clean! I get it! I forgot you had a sister - what's she doing again? STUDENT:
    She is starting going university.
    going to university",0.99907343,0.960302824
65751,"TEACHER:
    Oh right - so she's starting in MArch/April - that's the start of the academic year in Japan right? What's she going to study? STUDENT:
    From April!! And she is studying nutrition.",0.99880595,0.997174951
65752,"TEACHER:
    OK right - that sounds like a degree with a job at the end of it! By the way, you'd say: 'she's starting university' (without 'go')
    Hey <STUDENT>, going back to the master’s idea – do you have any idea where you might do it in the UK? STUDENT:
    I'm thinking about Edinborough and Bristol",0.975486911,0.929701074
65753,"TEACHER:
    Oh right, Edinburgh and Bristol - both quite cool cities i'd say - have you  been to either of them before? STUDENT:
    No, I've never been there.",0.998589095,0.994527739
65754,"TEACHER:
    Well like I say both a bit cooler than Cambridge! And bigger too - I guess that's partly why...<STUDENT> – back to complaining - imagine your parents – what do you think they would have said to complain about you in the past? (you have to imagine they spoke English for this obviously!). Give me an example….the problem and how they felt if you can… STUDENT:
    My parents would say I'm not good at cleaning my room.",0.116838303,0.969419261
65755,"TEACHER:
    OK right - a common parental complaint! Can you try saying that and using the structures from earlier?
    Begin with: He...
    He's always... STUDENT:
    He is always making his room messed up",0.866845173,0.996016389
65756,"TEACHER:
    OK great! Yes that's good...so 'He's always leaving his room in a mess' is good
    and how did they feel about it...? STUDENT:
    They thought it was because I would have a mental disease.haha",0.998849807,0.302325798
65757,"TEACHER:
    Oh god - I don't know if you're serious! 'They thought I might have a mental illness/be mentally ill' is good - No i think it means you were a perfectly normal teenager right?! STUDENT:
    Yes, at least I think so.haha",0.997947013,0.980252375
65758,"TEACHER:
    I think so! Any more complaints from you? About..I don't know...classmates (you don't have to use names!)
    Or people in your accommodation STUDENT:
    She is always trying to win against me. It was really annoying.",0.986179968,0.722205267
65759,"TEACHER:
    THanks - 'annoying' = good word here! do you mean like in a game? STUDENT:
    No, I mean in IELTS practices.",0.996490893,0.938413182
65760,"TEACHER:
    Ok I see - you mean get a higher score! STUDENT:
    Yes, I do.",0.847898604,0.579841808
65761,"TEACHER:
    <STUDENT> – just to practise this quickly – can you think of a way (or more than one if possible) :Liverpool 1 - Barcelona 0
    sorry - of describing that score I gave you
    in a sentence STUDENT:
    Liverpool won against Barcelona for 1-0.",0.851580303,0.998676882

    can you delete one word to make it correct? STUDENT:
    against??",0.475893993,0.358754233

    no try again! STUDENT:
    for??
    for??",,0.428039686

    Yes that's it! STUDENT:
    I didn't know that.",0.806867565,0.694796774
65765,"TEACHER:
    OK so your sentience is possible/good  -can you try another sentence with the word 'beat' for the same score STUDENT:
    Barcelona was beaten by Liverpool 1-0.",0.698350108,0.864176618
65766,"TEACHER:
    OK great! Or: Liverpool beat Barcelona 1-0 ('one nil' remember in speaking!) - also we normally say 'were' for a football team in speaking
    and 'they' you see STUDENT:
    Ah, because they are a team, right??",0.999495421,0.994676721
65767,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's it - you can use the singular too though especailly more formally (or imagine like thinking about the club as a company or whatever - definitely in that situation) So <STUDENT> - because you're IELTS example is not exactly like a knockout competiition you could say she's always trying to beat me  (as in my score) but not really win against me -
    OK?! STUDENT:
    Yes, I mean so. Even though IELTS isn't a competiton...",0.54004251,0.998030173
65768,"TEACHER:
    OK - you mean you still want to say 'win' - OK you can, you can - it's possible!
    to really emphasis she though of it like a compettiion I guess!
    thought
    OK <STUDENT> - we'll have to stop there - thanks a lot- speak to you soon STUDENT:
    Yeah, I think so.",0.99031628,0.695788094

    cheers! STUDENT:
    Okay",0.908414227,
65771,"STUDENT:
    Hi <TEACHER>
    still there??",,
65772,"TEACHER:
    Hi yes i'm here <STUDENT> - really sorry for delay... STUDENT:
    No worries, at the moment I have a lot of free time hehe",0.999183249,0.907875852
65773,"TEACHER:
    Yes I guess so...is the 'c' word something we should mention or do you want to avoid it completely?! STUDENT:
    I'm ok with the 'c' word ;)",0.23875231,0.999111152
65774,"TEACHER:
    OK well....can I ask - are you allowed to g o out at the moment? STUDENT:
    How are you in England? I haven't heard the news today but until yesterday you could have a normal life, couldn't you?",0.726928734,0.301469528
65775,"TEACHER:
    Yes more or less - but the current advice is to avoid social contact so things are slowing down fast...many entertainment venues are closing for example
    it's only a matter of time before more places are forced to shut down i think.... STUDENT:
    We are allowed to go out to the supermarket, pharmacy or to your work place. There is police stopping people and asking where they are going... it's very wired :(",0.340015601,0.677201108
65776,"TEACHER:
    Wow yeah that's pretty heavy - as I say that's definitely on the horizon here sooner rather than later...
    although weirdly the schools are sti;l open! STUDENT:
    I don't understand why they keep the schools open having the experiences of Italy and now Spain
    There are so many new cases every day... It's scary",0.392236539,0.998148146
65777,"TEACHER:
    Yeah I think the rationale is that: Stop key workers from having childcare commitments/prevent vulnerable grandparents from being exposed through providing childcare
    Yes I guess that the vast majority of young(ish) people are relatively safe in the event of contracting the illness right...but of course it's very worrying for older people STUDENT:
    Yes, here we had that situation at the beginning when they closed the schools but parents kept working... Now most of parents are working from home so they can look after their children and leave grandparents alone",0.271405489,0.971390195
65778,"TEACHER:
    Yes I see...intersting that they expect parents to be able to look after kids AND work at the same time!
    The situation at our school is pretty catastrophic to be honest...perhaps the end! STUDENT:
    Yessss, impossible for a lot of parents... specially because children have a lot of homework to do and they need help. My nephew is 10 years old and has to do 5 hours of homework a day, can you imagine?",0.999074489,0.989503817
65779,"TEACHER:
    Yes - that's a tough change to make for everyone! I'll be in the same boat in a couple of weeks I'm sure...
    Although I'll be effectively unemployed in fact from next week probably STUDENT:
    ohh really bad the news about your school... I guess there are not students travelling from their countries at the moment?",0.785564827,0.6512295
65780,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's right and the vast majority who were here have left early while they can still get flights I'll have to scratch around getting any online work I can STUDENT:
    It's going to be very difficult if the situation doesn't change very soon",0.946409888,0.821760877
65781,"TEACHER:
    Yes, like lots of businesses the school can't survive more than a few months without income
    not with the overheads STUDENT:
    I thought of online teaching, you can always do that. But if people can't work they don't have money to pay online classes... uffff hard",0.873526823,0.900713057
65782,"TEACHER:
    so all the staff will probably be laid off
    Yes that's true I guess - that's what everyone's doing but as you say the demand won't necessarily be there right now - we'l see!
    I'm planning lots of quality time at my allotment... STUDENT:
    That sounds like a very good plan
    Here you couldn't go to your allotment either!",0.983097353,0.998484098
65783,"TEACHER:
    THat's definitely over the top! I think that would never happen in the UK!
    I've decided that allotments are quintessentially British - i.e. kind of shared/communnal but not really the perfect liberal compromise
    I mean controlled social spaces you know? STUDENT:
    Sorry, I don't understand what you mean...
    Quintessentially??",0.995534342,0.999275378
65784,"TEACHER:
    Oh right....like the perfect example of seomthing
    as in allotments are a perfect example of Britishness
    or embody typical British values or whatever STUDENT:
    ahh I see",0.752837822,0.617580815
65785,"TEACHER:
    as in they provoke the feeling you should be sociable with your allotment 'neighbours' but there's no demand for you to be 'friends'!
    you can maintain priVACY/DISTANCE
    that's why British people like board games so much e.g. shared activity but with clear rules so that everything's under control! (maybe - just a theory - not an original one) STUDENT:
    I understand, and I see here there are a lot of places where we could be with people keeping the 2 meters distance that doctors recommend but we can't go anywhere... same in Italy
    haha I like the board games example",0.752103411,0.998432109
65786,"TEACHER:
    OK you mean (?) you should be able to go out as long as you stay 2 metres away from people
    as in: Why don't they let us? STUDENT:
    That is what we have to do when we go to the supermarket or to the pharmacy",0.990923122,0.623059094
65787,"TEACHER:
    Yes right - that must be strange - especially in Spain/Italy where you have less personal space - IN the UK 2 metres is almost normal anyway!
    There are lots of jokes in the media at the moment about that sort of thing i.e. it's the perfect excuse for BRitish people to feel less guilty about being...British! i.e. reserved etc STUDENT:
    But for example, there is a big avenue in front of my house where I could walk without getting too close to people but there is a police officer walking around (not all the time) asking people where they are going... If you go to the supermarket they ask you for the receipt... It's crazy! I go to the supermarket everyday to buy something so that I have some fresh air at list for half an hour",0.184423706,0.673049784
65788,"TEACHER:
    Wow - so if you live in a flat (do you?) you basically can't be outside at all really? STUDENT:
    Here there are soooo many jokes about everything... It's great because at least we laugh quite often...",0.930399934,0.221745253
65789,"TEACHER:
    Yes you've got to laugh or...(you know the ending right?) STUDENT:
    yes!!! I'm not suppose to leave at all. I'm very lucky, I can see the sea from my sofa and I live alone but I'm very sorry for families who live in a small flat with little children
    Noooo, I don't know the ending! please, tell me...",0.940311454,0.999254279
65790,"TEACHER:
    ..or you'd cry! Not really funny or clever - just wondered if you knew! Often we don't bother saying the second part like lots of idioms...
    Yes really tough as you say for people with toddlers etc I live in the middle of nowhere so I guess nobody can stop me from going for a walk where I am.... STUDENT:
    haha we have something similar! 'Me río por no llorar'",0.798430812,0.518549506
65791,"TEACHER:
    OK nice - thanks! Exactly the same really... STUDENT:
    You are very lucky there in the middle of nowhere",0.914128112,0.667339677
65792,"TEACHER:
    ya gotta laugh' is if you can imagine the quick spoken form of the phrase...
    Hey <STUDENT> do you read phonemic script by the way?
    As in you'd follow this right?: /jəgɒ(t)əlɑːf/ STUDENT:
    What is being very nice is that there are a lot of free stuff available online, specially on Instagram. There are free fitness, dancing, cooking, photography, yoga classes... Everything to keep us doing something!! I have a diary to be able to remember all the activities I'd like to do ;)
    Sorry, I go back to your question",0.689072203,0.637045355
65793,"TEACHER:
    Yes that's great - I guess we're luck to have the internet these days in this situation ...ok I'll wait.. STUDENT:
    I don't know all the symbols but I recognise a lot of them
    Every time I check a word in the dictionary (very often) I have a look at the phonemic script",0.956739446,0.872975696
65794,"TEACHER:
    OK I understand - well, can be useful I think - once you get used to it it's very quick - that's great you check in the dictionary STUDENT:
    Wait, do you check words in the dictionary?? or look up?",0.997791052,0.998991785
65795,"TEACHER:
    the more i teach the more I focus on pronunciation to b ehonest
    you can say check or look up - both fine (and common)
    I guess 'chec' could imply you kinda know a bit already and 'look up' can suggest you know nothing you see?
    check' I mean
    A new phrasal verb by the way used by young people (but not by me) = 'search up'
    As in: I'll search it up on my phone' - sounds horrible to me but lots of kids are saying that now! STUDENT:
    I think it's very important (pronunciation). I always check it when I have doubts because it's been difficult for me to make people understand me sometimes when I lived in England... Since I spend some time there the first time I went, I realised how important it is to know the correct pronunciation of words...
    I won't use search up then ;)",0.998973833,0.999154552
65796,"TEACHER:
    Yes I think that's great you focused on that - I remember the small amount of time I heard you speaking you seemd to have very good pronunciation (especailly for a Spanish speaker - sorry that sounds like a back-handed compliment) STUDENT:
    ohh thank you! I try hard :)
    What does back-handed compliment mean??ç",0.990996037,0.998457995
65797,"TEACHER:
    Um...a compliment that could be understood as an insult STUDENT:
    hahah",0.997793604,0.658787384
65798,"TEACHER:
    As in your pronuncation is good but only compared with other Spanish speakers who are generally terrible (and no I don't mean that entirely)
    ..but many Spaniards do need to focus more on pronunciation of course! STUDENT:
    I understand what you mean now",,0.75191292
65799,"TEACHER:
    It can be very frustrating if you don't do it fairly early on.. STUDENT:
    I think it's our teachers fault (teachers here). They don't care too much about it, here grammar seems to be veryyy important",0.591997094,0.838166604
65800,"TEACHER:
    Yes I'm sure you're right - I guess it'll change with the exposure to authentic speech on the internet etc
    it's definitely changed already in my expereince
    the average pronunciation of my younger students is better than 10 years ago for example
    cos they watch Netflix all the time...
    or youtube or whatever STUDENT:
    Yes, that's terrible. Every time I try to record a whatsapp message in English my phone doens't get a word :(. When I do it in Spanish it works perfectly...",0.983568501,0.888065781
65801,"TEACHER:
    Oh really? Its not because it's on the 'Spanish' setting is it? I'm sure you 're good enough to get a device to understand you no? STUDENT:
    Do you know what I am talking about? When you speak and your phone writes what you say...",0.994709455,0.775237822
65802,"TEACHER:
    Yes yes I know STUDENT:
    Nooo, in English, I change the language when I want to do it in English",0.899827325,0.576586899
65803,"TEACHER:
    Hey <STUDENT> did you notice my Spanish intefernce just not - seriously, when I put 'no' at the end of my sentence - that's not normal - it something i  retained from speaking Spanish years ago...
    cos it's more efficient STUDENT:
    haha no, I haven't realised until now that you said it. It's true that 'no' it's much easier than 'isn't it' 'don't you', etc",0.920013459,0.950695723
65804,"TEACHER:
    yes you know that in 50 years linguists predict that we will all say just 'innit?' in English (which currently is associated with lower class speakers)
    I say it for 'isn't it?' which is a little bit lower class (!) but some poeple say it for all question tags (which is definitely more frowned upon by snobs) STUDENT:
    I'd be very happy to take that lower class speakers habit!! ;)",0.848078546,0.997824791
65805,"TEACHER:
    Yes you'll be fine in 50 years!
    Ok <STUDENT> I guess that's an hour more or less right? I'm really sorry again about the delay today - I'll speak to you tomorrow at 13:15! STUDENT:
    It feels very artificial for me to use the question tags, when I use them I feel very posh haha
    Yes, thank you very much! See you tomorrow :)",0.872766583,0.935627037

    than I have to finish watching a vebinar about some marketing staff",0.870835468,0.935379737

    Do you mean the people who work for the school or some work you need to do for the school? the school staff
    Ah, now I see! it's stuff. some marketing stuff
    And staff = people who work in the company
    a staff meeting; staff room STUDENT:
    because they have limited access till 22/02 and I'm not sure that I'll have enough time on the weekend
    Ah! Sure! So in both sentences I meant stuff",0.997566489,0.335312492

    They are pronounced quite differently too, I would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff
    Yes, I got you)
    Sounds interesting, the webinar on marketing! STUDENT:
    I would recommend listening to the pronunciation in the dictionary. stuff vs. staff  - I'll do it!
    ok It's about lovemarks )",0.486587709,0.999448947

    Lovemarks?? STUDENT:
    The brands which love their clients",0.999420476,

65816,"TEACHER:
    Oh, where you can hire some clothes? I remember vaguely, something starting with O... STUDENT:
    Then she founded other services too: beauty, photo services, the shops with some nice stuff )
    Yes! To hire some clothes )
    The name is Oh my look )",0.98844843,0.998998722

    Wow, she's really branched out
    I've looked it up, apparently, lovemarks are supposed to replace the idea of brands. I've never heard about this stuff! STUDENT:
    branched out? )
    It means that she has lots of branches of her business?",0.385266049,0.997121985

    branch out = good business word; to start to do something different from what you usually do
    For example, if you now opened an ALMA bakery for students to go to after classes, that would be branching out
    Yes, it comes from the idea of branches of a business STUDENT:

66114,"STUDENT:
    Not many people were there...
    But it sounds different. TEACHER:
    in meaning you mean? it's OK - it has the same meaning (but sounds different yes because it's less formal!)
    Look, this is what I had already written to reply to your earlier question!: Yes the Lake District was lovely – not warm and sunny! – but the weather wasn’t too bad. There aren’t quite so many people in winter either so it’s a bit more peaceful you know? #",0.996163728,0.979516182
66115,"STUDENT:
    Hmm... I thought few people mean that we rarely see people. TEACHER:
    by the way, 'there weren't many people' is a more common order than 'not many people were there'
    um...'few' by itself doesn't give information about frequency
    how can you say the opposite? i.e. in winter there aren't many people but in summer...",0.986692526,0.008366627

    I see. It sounds like 'few' is fewer than 'not many', but it's the same, right?
    In summer there are many people. TEACHER:
    ah yes of course I see what you mean - yes it is a bit confusing i guess but yes you're absolutely right

    yeah that's it! Just to be clear: few and many are perfectly correct and fine but...you will hear people use (not) many  and lots
    much more often I mean
    in normal speaking",0.667861348,0.422474938
66119,"STUDENT:
    I see. So these words sound more natural, right?

    a lot of

    I've never heard 'loads'... TEACHER:
    Really? OK, it's really common seriously - I bet you'll notice it now I've mentioned it!",0.878178617,0.999502702

    Oh,Thank you. TEACHER:
    it's common in normal informal speech - also can be quite emphatic as in lots and lots!",0.737665784,0.843217206
66127,"STUDENT:
    So is it used like 'There are loads of people in London'
    ? TEACHER:
    Yeah absolutely... or e.g. I went to the swimming pool - there were loads of peopel because it's the school holidays...OK <STUDENT> one more! - 'rarely' = formal or normal?
    people
    of course e.g. 'crowded' is common too",0.994941823,0.736053236

    I think it's normal. TEACHER:
    ok...it's certainly perfectly possible and correct...can you think of a different word?!",0.823957005,0.996740884

    seldom? TEACHER:
    good idea! So in order of formality: seldom, rarely and hardly ever
    you've heard that before?",,0.589561657
66130,"STUDENT:
    So you mean hardly is the most casual? I know these words, but I've never thought about the order of formality. TEACHER:
    yes ' hardly ever' (two words together) is by far the most common in normal speaking. Just to clarify: 'seldom' = correct but very formal i.e. many English people will never have said it in their lives!",0.999270167,0.999496189
66131,"STUDENT:
    Hardly + ever', I see... He hardly ever  comes to school on time. Like that? TEACHER:
    Yep perfect example - and by far the most common form you would hear in everyday life - Quick pronunciation question <STUDENT>: can you imagine the difference in sound between the words 'aunt' as in opposite of uncle and 'aren't' (are not)",0.351613531,0.996252344

    Yes, I can... Aren't has 'r' sound. TEACHER:
    For most British people?",0.560659339,0.99877264
66133,"STUDENT:
    What do you mean? Do they sound the same in theUK? TEACHER:
    Yes exactly they sound exactly the same for me  so e.g. both are: /ɑːnt/  sorry, do you understand the phonemic symbols?",0.99888362,0.426208438
66134,"STUDENT:
    Oh, really!? Is that like a dialect? I can understand the phonemic symbols. TEACHER:
    But of course you can say them how you like <STUDENT>! (as in with an /r/ if you like - I'm just pointing it out for understanding! And Americans and many other English speakers do say it with an /r/ (but not generally in e.g. Cambridge - sorry just caught your last comment...that's funny! I like the idea of you telling English peopel who don't pronounce the /r/ that they're speaking a dialect! it's standard for most English people especially in the south and this is often regarded as having the neutral English accent - do you see?
    that's great you can read the symbols by the way - very useful
    now i can write more stuff!",0.99567965,0.999492781
66135,"STUDENT:
    I see, in Japan there are a lot of dialect, but in the UK, there are many kinds of accent... TEACHER:
    Right I see. You know that 'dialect' suggests different grammar and vocabulary right? So in the UK there aren't really many different dialects left but yes 0 as you say - lots of different accents
    have you noticed/heard any difference in accents in the UK",0.999344217,0.988218298
66136,"STUDENT:
    Interesting. Hmm... My friend said 'scone' has two accents. 'sco:n' and 'scoun'///
    I'm not sure if the symbols are correct TEACHER:
    ah  i see - a classic example! Yes good one! I guess that's just two ways of pronouncing the same word - more than an 'accent' thing you see? As in peopel who have basically the same accent might disagree about that particular word!
    and peopel who choose the same verision of that word might still have a different accent if you see what I mean?!
    version",0.996758661,0.994475495
66137,"STUDENT:
    Sorry, I cannot understand. What is the difference? TEACHER:
    so if i say /skɒn/ (and i do!) an e.g. Scottish person might say it that way too but i would still hear that they are SCottish
    and a person from the south of Egnland like me might say /skəʊn/ (not like me) but i would still hear that they have the same accent as me in general
    sorry <STUDENT> - have i confused you more?!",0.144272677,0.457654257
66138,"STUDENT:
    Oh, it's difficult for me to recognise the difference between the example of 'aren't' and 'scone' as I don't know the background! TEACHER:
    ok so the /r/ thing is a more useful distinction because it is a big general difference i.e. e.g. Americans normally have an /r/ and most English people don't BUT the 'scone' thing is just a word that everybody has arguments (joking) about the right way to say it i.e. it's not really an 'accent' or regional thing
    one more <STUDENT> - a really big accent thing: in the south of England we say /a:/  as in /bɑːθ/ and in the north they say /æ/",0.99656698,0.791115318
66139,"STUDENT:
    I see. I got it. Ah, how about the word 'staff'? In American English it sounds like /staef/ but in the UK it sounds like /sta:f/ TEACHER:
    ha! yes great ecample!!!!!!!!
    example
    the same as in America in the north of the UK but less nasal!",0.995608433,0.990218362

    That's interesting.

    what does it mean 'essential'?",0.983826205,0.999281889

66164,"TEACHER:
    It's the oil that we can use on a wheel to stop the squeak STUDENT:

66315,"STUDENT:
    okay I am ready
    so
    my holiday is a bit strange
    sometimes it is lazy and not interesting but sometimes it is exciting!
    for example
    I wake up at 11-12
    and I do nothing for hours
    then I go out with somebody
    that’s not easy to make new ideas what to do
    for example yesterday I didn’t know what to do TEACHER:
    Are you back in Kyiv then?",0.523864403,
66316,"STUDENT:
    than my friend calls me and says that she wrote her ZNO and the school where she wrote it isn’t far from my house
    yes, I’m back in Kyiv TEACHER:
    I see! Sounds like you've got plenty of time on your hands - nice!
    Are you going to do any summer classes  or maybe go to a summer camp? Or maybe visit your family again?",0.935969312,0.999203566
66317,"STUDENT:
    than I call my another friend and we also went out
    I thought it would be another boring day
    I go to exam booster from IH TEACHER:
    Oh interesting! Which exam are you preparing for?",0.955319064,0.900645591
66318,"STUDENT:
    We can’t visit our family because Israel doesn’t let anybody there from Ukraine
    I’m not preparing for something
    just for the future
    now I know some more tricks for Listening TEACHER:
    Oh shame! You haven't seen your family in Israel for a long time now, have you?",0.988637845,0.82514518

    we are studying from IELTS book TEACHER:
    Ah, interesting!",0.883606645,0.596534969

    yes I haven’t TEACHER:
    IELTS, ok, I see!",0.842947029,0.249869004
66321,"STUDENT:
    from 2019 TEACHER:
    The IELTS certificate is only valid for 2 years as you probably know, so yes, it only makes sense to take IELTS when you need it!",0.240992766,0.81743305
66322,"STUDENT:
    so now I know that Listening in IELTS and the whole IELTS test is evil TEACHER:
    Haha, well, there is a reason for it",0.864661376,0.998777626
66323,"STUDENT:
    in the end of our course(25 of June) we will have a trial test TEACHER:
    IELTS is a multilevel test. People who are only beginners and people who are fluent take the same test
    However, there are lots of level tests that Cambridge has developed. The one that will be good for you to prepare for if you're interested is B2",0.970864047,0.712536326
66324,"STUDENT:
    yeah, I think our book is intermediate or intermediate plus TEACHER:
    Yes, I think the B2 test should be the right level of challenge for you
    Sorry, it's B2 First (it used to be called FCE)
    Here's a link if you're curious
    Unlike IELTS, a B2 First certificate is forever (it doesn't expire)",0.728153419,0.562834111

    the link doesn’t work TEACHER:
    Ah, it doesn't work in this chatroom, sorry! You can just search for 'Cambridge B2 First' using your search engine",0.994495889,0.988966118
66326,"STUDENT:
    yeah I checked the site
    are you here? TEACHER:
    Sure. How did it go with the final test, by the way?",0.367338687,0.871880542

    thanks TEACHER:
    So... As I mentioned, this is our final class! Is there anything you would like to talk about? Exams? Tips on how to work on your English in the future? Books? Anything else?
    Maybe you've got a burning grammar question you've been dying to ask me this whole time?",,0.883266952
66330,"STUDENT:
    oh, maybe we can talk about tips on how to work my English in the future) TEACHER:
    Absolutely!",0.9530276,0.999454304
66331,"STUDENT:
    now I just understand now that I will miss so much :(
    *how
    oh my god TEACHER:
    Aww, I will miss you too! It will be weird, we've been talking for a year now! You always have my Skype if you'd like to message me, right?",0.991174842,
66332,"STUDENT:
    of course
    do you have any plans for summer? TEACHER:
    Soo... I understand that your goal is to learn 'all English' and be able to communicate fluently. That's the general goal. But right now, what would you like to be able to do in English? Talk to people? Watch movies? Listen to songs and understand lyrics? Chat to other Roblox players from other countries?
    I do, yes! We're working (and my son is at school) until the end of July, and then we're going on holiday (yaaaay!) to Cornwall. It's a beautiful (and warm!) place in England, in the south-west
    In the meantime, I'm enjoying the beautiful English summer and especially my garden :)",0.408380819,0.745481023
66333,"STUDENT:
    well, for me it is important to understand what I listen to or what I read, even if I don’t know the word, I can understand it from the other text, by the way, I want to know more about the difference between different English countries
    Is Cornwall a city?
    Wow, you will have only one month of holiday! Why? TEACHER:
    Cornwall is a county. Do you remember, at the very beginning we were talking about the UK being divided into counties? it's like 'oblast'",0.996909721,0.998107203
66334,"STUDENT:
    oh yeah TEACHER:
    Schoolchildren in this country only get 6 weeks of summer holidays, yes!
    If you imagine the map of the UK, Cornwall is in the bottom left corner :)",0.411758452,0.311700459
66335,"STUDENT:
    that’s sad😢
    oh , makes sense TEACHER:
    Yes, it's unusual for us, isn
    isn't it
    But at least it gives parents a chance to work. Not many people would be able to take 3 months off to spend with the kids!
    Back to the UK. It's made up of 4 countries. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are all very different and have their local governments. But of course, there's a general UK government and parliament in London
    But you probably know that, right?",0.287145583,0.736852514
66336,"STUDENT:
    yes!
    at least I know it from the texts from English books, not from Geography lesson! TEACHER:
    Yes, sure, it should be in your English texts!
    Ok, to go back to understanding what you hear and what you read in English!
    The key to understanding is words. I really believe there's no way round it, to learn a language you need to learn lots of new words (and I also think this is the fun part, too!)
    I really recommend a good dictionary. Lots of people use online translations, but a good English-English dictionary that explains instead of translating can do so much more!
    I always recommend Cambridge English dictionary online. You can listen to the pronunciation there too and there are pictures and quizzes!",0.997739737,0.864499801
66337,"STUDENT:
    Yes , I know that translation words is not as good as understanding them, for example when you speak you remember the translation, not the word TEACHER:
    Exactly!
    And then just use your favourite way to memorize words, maybe an app or a notebook or post-it notes
    How do you prefer to learn new words?",0.984517826,0.998777461
66338,"STUDENT:
    I tried using an app for studying words but it was boring TEACHER:
    Ok, sure. Just a notebook always worked for me, especially a small one that I could carry with me everywhere",0.737069707,0.999235395
66339,"STUDENT:
    if I need to study them I just repeat them a lot of times and if I don’t know the meaning I google it
    also I have a vocabulary notebook, I write words there from the fifth form TEACHER:
    Sounds perfect!",0.784943003,0.980917458
66340,"STUDENT:
    but it is for school, so there are not meanings, just translation TEACHER:
    In terms of listening, the trick to understanding is actually pronunciation! Once you start to understand how English pronunciation works, you can understand so much more when you hear it!
    Sure, you can always create a new one just for yourself, right?",0.963724115,0.878352539
66341,"STUDENT:
    yes TEACHER:
    We haven't been able to do much pronunciation work here, obviously :)
    But! There's a really nice series on the BBC Learning English website
    It's called Tim's Pronunciation Workshop
    It's really useful (and funny too!) and teaches you how to understand when people speak fast and don't pronounce every word very carefully",,0.766651879
66342,"STUDENT:
    I will also check it later
    I found the site TEACHER:
    You can just find it through your search engine because links don't work as we know
    Perfect! There's lots of fun stuff to do there, too!
    And of course, if you'd like a project, I always recommend reading in English (and learning those new words), and our favourites, the HP books are perfect for this
    The first two books are written for younger readers as you know, and the language is not as difficult. By the time you get to the third book, you've already got some experience reading in English and it's easier for you anyway!
    The way I used to approach reading in English was to learn every single new word at first! It's hard work at first and you can only read a few pages at a time, but then, after a few chapters it becomes so much easier! There are usually very few new words by the end of the book",0.943655924,0.057787778
66343,"STUDENT:
    I think I will try
    maybe not the whole book
    something not long TEACHER:
    Yes, you can take it slowly at first and then see how it goes!",0.553903449,0.959251507
66344,"STUDENT:
    I think somebody gave me an English book
    as a gift TEACHER:
    Obviously, if there's a blog / Insta / tik tok account that you like in English, that could be perfect for smaller texts",0.972233648,0.538767303
66345,"STUDENT:
    probably I like watching tiktok videos on English
    for example I watch an anime TEACHER:
    Oh yes, I think you mentioned it before!",0.785489172,0.982743766
66346,"STUDENT:
    and there is a Russian side of it
    and there is English side TEACHER:
    Oh, like a comic?",0.491710234,0.913869309
66347,"STUDENT:
    no, just some videos in tiktok TEACHER:
    Ah sure!",0.786647084,0.916243367
66348,"STUDENT:
    you see, if you watch anything (anime, serial , film or else ) you can see some different fandom videos on tiktok TEACHER:
    Ok, <STUDENT>, I've got to let you go now! Thank you for participating in this project and helping science! It's been a pleasure to talk to you and teach you :)",0.270577369,0.916899623
66349,"STUDENT:
    fandom it is fans of something TEACHER:
    Aah, I didn't know that! about fandom videos. I don't know much about tiktok I'm afraid!",0.998847517,0.249902265
66350,"STUDENT:
    thank you so much too! That was really fun and interesting to participate! Thank you so much for everything you’ve done to me! I am going to miss you so much! I think we will chat in Skype ! TEACHER:
    I'm going to miss you to! Take care, have a wonderful summer, write on Skype! :))",0.996963664,0.125398092

    Hi! Sorry I need a couple more minute",,

    Hi <STUDENT>, no problem STUDENT:
    Here I am :) How are you?",0.985307981,0.985894996

    All good...it is even a beautiful day here :)",0.986619435,0.932959574
66356,"TEACHER:
    It's actually starting to feel like spring here! Daffodils are starting to pop through, and I've got snowdrops in my garden :) STUDENT:
    Oh, that's nice! I am also looking forward to seeing spring...so far it has really been a cold winter!",0.961819677,0.992489566
66357,"TEACHER:
    Yes, it has been a colder winter! Which is good, but we've all really had enough by now STUDENT:
    Indeed! How is it going with the lockdown? Here it looks like next week they will remove some restriction...
    *restrictions",0.999479797,0.143091145
66358,"TEACHER:
    Oh really? I'm so happy for you!
    Well, we're in lockdown until at least March 8, and then there is going to be a phased exit with areas dropping restrictions but others still being quite strict
    They're now trying to trace and contain this South African variant which is also more contagious
    We are well stir crazy by now, fantasizing about travelling all the time and watching escapist TV STUDENT:
    haha...
    My current dream is to experience silence for a day...without hearing screams or cries from my children...
    but I will have to wait a bit longer for that...",0.999483497,0.693185985
66359,"TEACHER:
    I'm feeling for you. Toddlerhood is tough!
    Didn't you say the childminder was still allowed to work? STUDENT:
    Yes...luckily she has always been allowed to work, so I had a few free mornings...
    but for a number of reasons she never worked 5 days a week...anyhow, if I didn't go crazy it is probably also thanks to her help",0.900835716,0.996727595
66360,"TEACHER:
    Good that you have some support! I can only say that it gets easier with time. Just as sweet, but a bit easier :) STUDENT:
    I really hope so :) well, to be onest the oldest child, almost 3, is starting to behave a bit..now it is his brother who is a bit problematic...",0.950747032,0.915817467
66361,"TEACHER:
    Yes, they call this age 'the terrible twos' here, even though he isn't even 2 yet! STUDENT:
    I have hear that expression, yes...we don't have it in Italian, but it should definitely be imported!",0.952075963,0.360741623
66362,"TEACHER:
    Haha, yes, but the danger is, once you say this, you start to see them in this way
    And three-year-olds are sometimes called 'threenagers'
    Because they can be moody like teenagers STUDENT:
    Haha...I had never heard of that expression!
    Threenagers, it sounds funny :)",0.14677671,0.998737126
66363,"TEACHER:
    It does :))
    Ok, shall we have a look at the rest of the idioms from comments? STUDENT:
    Yes!
    I was just going to say that the last week was extremely busy so I still haven't read the article...but I will!",0.772058152,0.814320117
66364,"TEACHER:
    There are a couple more that I wanted to share with you
    You don't have to! I just thought it might give you some context, but it's by no means obligatory
    Oh, I think we didn't mention the meaning of 'play up' that is to do with children STUDENT:
    Don't worry...it is for me: the more I work on this, the more I learn
    No, we didn't...",0.64536644,0.650436118
66365,"TEACHER:
    We talked about play up / play down, didn't we? STUDENT:
    Yes, even though I can't remember exactly the meaning
    and I am pretty sure children weren't involved",0.897726588,0.784133341
66366,"TEACHER:
    Yes, you can talk about the crazy English notion of 'class' :)
    Yes, we talked in terms of 'exaggerate / minimize the importantce of'
    *sorry, I meant 'you can learn' STUDENT:
    OH yes, now I recall!",0.887725525,0.707260527
66367,"TEACHER:
    Yes, but 'play up' (or 'act up') has another meaning: start to misbehave
    For example, little Peter is playing up a bit, he must be tired
    The boys have been playing up at school again STUDENT:
    My son <STUDENT'S SON> always plays up after finishing a meal.",0.625430328,0.985548205
66368,"TEACHER:
    After finishing a meal? Because he's full and happy? :) STUDENT:
    No, because he's full and realizes that left over food has a big potential, if you want to soil the whole room.",0.999480803,0.999209649
66369,"TEACHER:
    Haha :))
    Sorry, I shouldn't laugh! STUDENT:

66370,"TEACHER:
    a big potential as an art material
    Definitely
    Ok, we talked about 'giving someone a leg up', didn't we? STUDENT:
    Indeed...well, maybe the story about Cattelan's banana reached even the UK? The artist who used a banana for one of his art pieces...
    Yes, my childminder is giving me a leg up...would it be okay if used like this?",0.360965598,0.99930465
66371,"TEACHER:
    No, is it a recent story? I haven't heard!
    Hmm, no, unless she paid for your PhD! :)) STUDENT:
    No, that's not the case ;)
    It's from 2019, so ages ago https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773
    okay...but I am giving a leg up to my children...",0.674852676,0.935398361
66372,"TEACHER:
    The childminder probably gives your boys a leg up if they want to climb somewhere but can't
    Yes!
    you are giving your children a leg up
    Ah, now I remember, the image rings a bell!
    of a banana I mean STUDENT:
    Yes, it is one of those dumb stories that gets a lot of news coverage for a few days...so it would probably ring a beel to almost anyone",0.999449299,0.656683601
66373,"TEACHER:
    Oh, this is an interesting comment, on the fluidity / rigidity of the class system
    The mistake is assuming that the middle class is closer to the upper class than to the working class. Losing one's job can make you go from middle class to working class in a heartbeat, but most will never even be close to the upper class even if they spend a lifetime doing very well.
    I think there are two nice expressions here, but which one would you pick?
    ones STUDENT:
    in a hartbeat'...meaning in a very short time",0.240979835,0.599856029
66374,"TEACHER:
    Yes, exactly! a very good one STUDENT:
    to be honest I don't see a second one",0.878574067,0.83479906
66375,"TEACHER:
    Oh, I meant 'to spend a lifetime (doing something)'
    Thinking about it, do well is also a good one
    Also, do well out of... She is a songwriter and is doing surprisingly well out of it
    which means have financial success STUDENT:
    Because of covid, many people aren't doing that well right now...",0.402425696,0.441592049
66376,"TEACHER:
    Exactly!
    Covid cost so many people their livelihoods
    Ok, one last
    I admit it's not rocket science sociology. But the government probably need a commission to help them to understand this. So I hope the writer is doing his bit there.
    Have you heard the expression 'it's not rocket science'? STUDENT:
    Yes, to be honest I think it is used more often in the US, could that be the case?
    Anyway, it means 'it is nothing that complex'",0.999152796,0.910178357
66377,"TEACHER:
    Hmm, I would say it's used in the UK as well!
    Yes, of course! What's a synonymous expression? 'It's not ___ ___'
    that is another field of knowledge STUDENT:
    oh... I really don't know...I know many people think math is hard, so I would guess 'It's not like math' but it doesn't sound right",0.996635645,0.619768588
66378,"TEACHER:
    Nope, but good guess! The expression is 'it's not brain surgery'
    I've got to remember to send you a link to a comedy sketch about these two expressions after class STUDENT:
    I am pretty sure I had never hear that one...okay!",0.948499729,0.767320692
66379,"TEACHER:
    Do you enjoy English comedy? STUDENT:
    Cool :) Yes, I do...to be honest I like it better than Italian comedy, which I find too dumb (as in I want to go outside of the room because it is too ashaming even to watch).",0.853191055,0.998042045
66380,"TEACHER:
    Oh no! I'm trying to think what I know of Italian comedy. English can be pretty silly but can be quite sophisticated STUDENT:
    There are some movies which are produced for Christmas in Italy, called 'cinepanettone' (panettone-movie) which represent this Italian awful comedy...",0.99770431,0.989469943
66381,"TEACHER:
    There is an English comedy website that does always cheer me up, it's called the Daily Mash. It kind of mimics a newspaper, but the news is satire STUDENT:
    Another example is Checco Zalone, his comedy is actually a bit better...",0.771633879,0.977278826
66382,"TEACHER:
    It especially likes to make fun of middle class people
    Ah, I'm with you, there are awful awful awful comedy shows on TV in the UK, they make me blush too!
    And they also seem to culminate around Christmas STUDENT:
    I'll give it a look! We also have such satirical papers in Italian, I guess the most well known is 'lercio' meaning 'filthy'...but to be honest some of their pages are good, and the name is more of a pun with 'leggo' (I read) which is a newspaper.",0.958956404,0.135462556
66383,"TEACHER:
    Ok, interesting!
    I must warn that it can be quite sweary. But funny!
    I'm thinking back to the expression you used, for something that provokes shame. We can say 'I'm ashamed of', but it doesn't really work with an -ing STUDENT:
    Haha, I see...well, to be honest, I believe the italian culture is less concerned with swearing than the anglo-saxon one...I mean, it is a 'bad' thing...but it took me years to understand why on american tv shows they were censoring certain words...",0.75885042,0.99554857
66384,"TEACHER:
    embarrassing' would probably be a good one here STUDENT:
    Okay...yes, I wasn't really sure how to express that...I find italian comedy often embarrassing",0.528022231,0.99065441
66385,"TEACHER:
    Hmm, actually, I wonder if Americans are more concerned with swearing than Brits
    Brits love to swear, including on TV
    Yes, and a good collocation is 'excrutiatingly embarrassing' STUDENT:
    really? I had never noticed...but then, I don't watch much tv from the UK...",0.839390376,0.863365751
66386,"TEACHER:
    You know, excrutiating = horribly painful STUDENT:
    Nice :)",0.187911859,0.471533027

    excrutiating pain; excrutiatingly embarrassing STUDENT:
    Yes, I know that expression :)",0.692302824,0.404013232

    I can imagine Americans would be more prude about swearing
    Looking at it, I bet it's from Latin too

    Yes!",0.306882714,0.796127426

    yes, that all",0.99940843,0.676816069
66933,"TEACHER:
    OK thanks hold on...
    OK thanks <STUDENT>....I get the idea of your first sentence:  “It is difficult for children to realise between games word and reality.”…...so to make this clearer in English we have a few options ok?! One choice would be to add the words 'the difference' e.g. the difference between e.g.  “It is difficult for children to tell the difference between video games and reality.” A more formal verb is ‘distinguish’ e.g. “It is difficult for children to distinguish between video games and reality”. OR you could also say:  “It is difficult for children to realise that video games are not real.”!
    But you can't say; ...'realise between...'

    OK nice! Here's your next one coming up ...can i ask you to think about your use ofsingular and plural here please? Because some games is for adults to forget pressure, and sometime it may have many violent content.
    By te way you can see I have changed contexts to 'content' - this is a good noun here ok? STUDENT:
    okey, i saw it...I think adult is may a singular",0.974391922,0.998700313

    and the next word you have to change to the plural??

    a tiny little word...!
    You OK <STUDENT>?
    OK sorry - I'll help!
    you need to change 'it' to  'they'

    no... but I study it now",0.960846022,0.888480923
66940,"TEACHER:
    OK fine...yes  so e.g. 'Some children bully others.' 'Some children are bullies.' (noun for person)
    Some children are bullied at school  = passive

    OK?! STUDENT:

    Lovely! Could you re-read the paragraphs about advertising, please? STUDENT:
    So I read again. Then try to write an essay including my previous sentences
    Ok, sure",0.876893993,0.976447494
67050,"TEACHER:
    Yes! I think this first sentence could be a good start, what do you think?
    Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil. STUDENT:
    Agree",0.784563706,0.647200417
67051,"TEACHER:
    Feel free to add a couple of sentences for the intro STUDENT:
    One quick question",,0.718252291
67052,"TEACHER:
    Sure STUDENT:
    WHat do you think the author means by 'digital advertising' in the second article?
    Digital billboards
    or internet ads
    I mean, digital billboards on the streets",0.963571759,
67053,"TEACHER:
    That's a good question, I've been thinking myself! I think they mean digital billboards, because it needs to correlate with the first paragraph
    and the contrast is, posters in the past vs. digital billboards now
    or at least it must be! STUDENT:
    Ok. So it probably correlates with the previous artcile
    article",0.999483249,0.987804154
67054,"TEACHER:
    Yes, it should! Two views of the same thing STUDENT:
    If that's not the case then I would have argued differently. Hence the question",0.975006472,0.453089471
67055,"TEACHER:
    So let's stick to the idea of digital billboards
    Aha, I see! How? STUDENT:
    Yes.
    haha
    I need to thinl
    think",0.251485163,0.639842516
67056,"TEACHER:
    Sure! STUDENT:
    Something about that there's no escape from the advertising frenzy, neither online, not offline. And you'll have to become immune at some point and maybe teach your children to do the same, see through things
    neither ... nor",0.838635573,
67057,"TEACHER:
    Yes, I see!
    Your original point was that we have no choice when exposed to billboards, we can't block them like on the Internet STUDENT:
    Yes.",0.988389632,0.602824341
67058,"TEACHER:
    Shall we go at paragraphs one by one, and then you choose which idea you'd like to express? or potentially both STUDENT:
    That's if we think about digital boards on the streets
    I'd like to continue expressing the first one
    So I have to write by hand the whole essay now, right?",,0.967019182
67059,"TEACHER:
    I think it's a very promising one, easy to write about! STUDENT:
    Yes, much easier.",0.783001959,0.972119739
67060,"TEACHER:
    Can you type it here, please, sentence by sentence? You've got the first sentence! STUDENT:
    Here? OK!",0.532771932,0.644290323

    And I'll be saving them for you STUDENT:
    in 2 mins I'll start, Ok?",0.910706781,0.604909106

    Lovely!
    Since the dawn of advertising people have been debating over whether the ads are an abomination or a necessary evil.
    the first sentence again STUDENT:
    It is hard to imagine a single day when you're not bombarded with advertisements, in one way or another.",0.529824318,0.993651562
67064,"TEACHER:
    Yes, 'bombarded with' = lovely! STUDENT:
    You may think it's necessary or you may be appalled - one thing is clear, there's little you can do about it. However, this is only partly true for the virtual world.",0.997775481,0.280725353
67065,"TEACHER:
    Right, I'm just thinking... are we still in the introduction part?
    There's surely more than one way about it, but shall we say for now,  1)a general introduction 2) opinion 1 3) opinion 2 4) your opinion STUDENT:
    I'm positive that even the biggest and most loyal fans of the advertising world, who consider ads to be fun, informative and overall a charming addition to both city and rural landscapes - even those people have an ad-blocker installed on their Pcs.
    Maybe omit 'even those people'?",0.912575754,0.218368823
67066,"TEACHER:
    Ok, that's a great sentence, but you are going back to billboards, aren't you??
    yes, a comma after landscapes and 'have an ad-blocker...' STUDENT:
    I'm trying to continue what I wrote last time.
    Or we're doing a new version?
    So I need more introduction then, right?",0.999353709,0.503766242
67067,"TEACHER:
    No, you're right, we're building on the old one!
    I would say so, and then proceed to the next paragraph that can start with a topic sentence
    Boring, but well-structured!
    Ah, I've got to let you go! Shall we continue in two weeks' time? STUDENT:
    Sure. I'll try to maybe write it on my own",0.978517113,0.918528198

    Sure, feel free to email it to me then! STUDENT:
    Thank you!",0.950181342,0.778508795

67072,"TEACHER:
    Hi there...",,
67073,"STUDENT:
    hey, I am here TEACHER:
    OK so,  let's have a think about this again <STUDENT> OK? Don't answer yet but here is what we're going to do:  'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'
    So <STUDENT>....what action happened first? you seeing the table or me teaching you?",0.458296777,0.993057093
67074,"STUDENT:
    I seeing table firstly TEACHER:
    Are you sure? Was i your teacher before that?!",0.511068176,0.999496815
67075,"STUDENT:
    wow..you teach us first and then gave to us the table chart TEACHER:
    OK good! And was I also your teacher After you saw the table?",0.998768319,0.543939732
67076,"STUDENT:
    yes, you are also my teacher. TEACHER:
    OK fine! So we have two actions right? ONE of them ('seeing the table' ) happened 'inside' the other - the second one existed (me teaching you) existed before, during AND after the other
    So do we use the past simple for BOTH actions?",0.972121116,0.998838612
67077,"STUDENT:
    no,,I think one of them is past perfect TEACHER:
    Ah ok I see your idea...well past perfect is some that happened BEFORE something else -BUT this is different because the other thing happened before, DURING and AFTER OK?",0.998278488,0.956790095
67078,"STUDENT:
    yes TEACHER:
    OK <STUDENT> so imagine: I look out of my window and I see a man i have never seen before OK? Maybe I ask myself: At the moment...what ________(do)?
    Choose a tense <STUDENT> to complete the question!",,0.669967077
67079,"STUDENT:
    what are you doing?
    what should I do? TEACHER:
    OK yes good exactly: 'what's he doing? ' and the answer maybe is: 'Nothing special ...He ___ just ____ (walk) along the street'",0.338329639,0.573715549
67080,"STUDENT:
    He is just walking along the street. TEACHER:
    OK good thanks hold on
    So two action right? Which one started first? (the seeing or the walking?)",0.943678706,0.999495911
67081,"STUDENT:
    walking is the first action TEACHER:
    OK good fine so...we have two tenses: the present simple and the present continuous OK?",0.778170193,0.999031689
67082,"STUDENT:
    and during he is walking, I saw him, after I seeing him, he still walking along the street. TEACHER:
    yes exactly good! So the seeing is 'inside' the walking!",0.990973086,0.097066905
67083,"STUDENT:
    yes,ok TEACHER:
    SO...your original sentence was : 'I saw this when you_______(teach) us.'
    THis is in the past it's true but the logic is the same...",,0.62666214
67084,"STUDENT:
    so...I saw the table when you teaching us. because you are my teacher before you give to me the table and during you giving and after you giving to me TEACHER:
    So the first verb is in the past simple good ...and the second needs to be the....??
    Yes yes that's it!",0.967073203,0.996219276
67085,"STUDENT:
    wow..I got it
    I never understand it before you teaching me this stuff. TEACHER:
    Yes that's ok ...So you need the PAST CONTINUOUS - how do we make it? We need to two parts remember? the PRESENT continuous = is/are + ____ing and the PAST continuous?",0.953605626,0.49166602
67086,"STUDENT:
    was/were + __ing TEACHER:
    OK great so...'I__________ it when you ____  ______ us.'??",0.584143466,0.999216514

    ok TEACHER:
    So I can say about myself for example: 1. I saw the first Lord of the Rings film when I was living in Spain. 2. yesterday I was driving to the supermarket when I saw a police car stop someone in their car. 3. I was going to school when I realized my phone was at home. etc etc ...Can you think of a couple of examples (true if possible - but they don't have to be interesting!) for yourself?)",,0.763321685

67093,"STUDENT:
    yes,,I always need to think which actions is a big in order to confirm the other is inside it. TEACHER:
    yes OK i see - it'll get more automatic over time if you keep practising...
    <STUDENT> - let me give you a couple of examples about how you can use the present perfect or present continuous in IELTS essays OK? Hold on a sec....",0.72707123,0.460607768
67094,"STUDENT:
    okey, I still practising this sentence after class. TEACHER:
    OK good",0.943514592,0.988792129

    okey TEACHER:
    By the way ..you vcan save them and copy and paste your examples in our lesson tomorrow if you like ok?",,0.894548357
67096,"STUDENT:
    yes, I like TEACHER:
    Hi sorry - internet went out there for a minute
    OK <STUDENT> so let me give you a few typical sentences for essay introductions and we can think about the use of the present perfect/present continuous....hold on
    Remember the problem and solution essay we did in class about the lack of teachers?",0.171789883,0.962343529
67097,"STUDENT:
    yes ,it is always happen...firstly I am unhappy with that.. but I rebased I need to clam down and get a good mood with this problem. TEACHER:
    Yes you're right ...count to ten and keep calm....",0.504973365,0.417394584
67098,"STUDENT:
    yes, I still remembering the easy of problem and solution. TEACHER:
    OK right...so in the intro maybe we might want to say (for the background sentence) something like: ' The number of teachers ___________ (go down) in recent decades.' Can you put the verb in the right tense?",0.698514179,0.631787319
67099,"STUDENT:
    decline
    decrease TEACHER:
    So you copy the verb 'go down' - it's fine! But what tense??
    you can copy the verb",0.49129702,0.280391976
67100,"STUDENT:
    declined/decreased/went down TEACHER:
    OK thanks so you;ve chosen the past simple which maybe seems logical BUT the time phrase 'in recent decades' means UP TO AND INCLUDING NOW so....we need the...??",0.72607087,0.663470961
67101,"STUDENT:
    in this intro, do we need the structure of ' it is argued that...'
    we need the present continuous TEACHER:
    Um....not really beacuse the lack of teachers would be given as a fact not an opinion or disagree with you see?
    to agree or disagree with i mean",0.793373641,0.974009287
67102,"STUDENT:
    okey,i understand TEACHER:
    OK so if i say 'this year' has the time finished?",0.764872295,0.682974977
67103,"STUDENT:
    if we got the date of this year I think it finished. TEACHER:
    Ah well if we say e.g. 24th March 2020 then yes it;s finished BUT if we ONLY say 'this year' has it finished?",0.999106468,0.999305172
67104,"STUDENT:
    no ,it not finished
    so we use present simple
    or present continue TEACHER:
    OK good - so some time phrases AUTOMATICALLY need the past simple OR the present perfect OK? It depends on the phrase",0.998548696,0.998820387
67105,"STUDENT:
    okey, I understand. TEACHER:
    So e.g. last year/last week/2018/ = ? (past simple or present perfect?)",0.86106798,0.165481937
67106,"STUDENT:
    present simple because it is specific time TEACHER:
    OK fine (you mean past simple right?!)",0.998440351,0.999128459
67107,"STUDENT:
    yes TEACHER:
    OK!
    OK good! and one more...what about 'this morning'  ? Past simple or present perfect?
    IN real life today!",,0.831748772
67108,"STUDENT:
    this morning is...past simple I guess TEACHER:
    Yes good!",0.710767275,0.999445521
67109,"STUDENT:
    because everyday and every time is specific. TEACHER:
    Yes that's right - OK so finally: 'in recent decades'? Past simple or present perfect? Remember the logic of the essay question is : We have a problem NOW with a lack of teachers.",0.8595681,0.865402161
67110,"STUDENT:
    let me think
    past simple! TEACHER:
    OK so remember the result will be either: 'In recent decades the number of teachers has gone down...' OR 'In recent decades the number of teachers went down....",0.693843391,0.997307724
67111,"STUDENT:
    because in recent year is present perfect
    yes..in recent years this problem is big action, NOW is inside it TEACHER:
    YEs good! that keyword is 'recent' which makes us use the present perfect in English because ot means up to and including now you see? NOT a finished time with less connection to now...",0.998416651,0.951333871
67112,"STUDENT:
    yes.. I think I can understand it now TEACHER:
    Yes I see what you mean about 'inside it' - i guess that;s true - in other words the number of teachers hasn't exactly STOPPED going down that's right
    We'll do more tomorrow with more essay intros ok?",0.276066878,0.774874195
67113,"STUDENT:
    yes that is what I like to do TEACHER:
    OK great thanks <STUDENT> see you tomorrow...",0.74785034,0.204559605
